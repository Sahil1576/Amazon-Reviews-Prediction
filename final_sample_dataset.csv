"My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet. I did some research, and this stuff is made by the same company, with a nearly identical ingredients list. While i was mixing in his old food with this stuff to acclimate him, he'd pick out the new food until he ate it all, leaving behind his purina!<br />As far as helping his gingivitis, it's helped a little. The plaque has gone down considerably, but the gumline is still reddish. He really loves this stuff, so I'll probably buy this again.",Positive
I knew it has food coloring before I purchased it but I didn't think it has that much of it.<br /><br />I had several drops of tea on my hand and it made my hand so orange and it is difficult to get rid of.<br /><br />The taste is not too bad but I feel like drinking chemicals after that.<br /><br />Also it has a lot of fine dust of tea that go thru the drainer.( The drainer is pretty fine.) So I can see the dark deposit at the bottom of the glass.<br /><br />I will buy another brand next time.,Negative
"Quote ""Assam tea is known for its body, briskness, malty flavor, and strong, bright color.""<br /><br />This offering is pretty abysmal, it is lacking in every department, maybe it was mislabeled. I am not sure what I am going to do with it!!",Negative

"My father is a real fan of York Peppermint Patties, unfortunately they dont sell those at home so when I travel, I always plan ahead to purchase them.

"This coffee has a smooth, carmely, dark finish that I love! My husband gets other dark blends that taste like charcoal to me. This one is very smooth, with just a hint of sweetness. I wish that Amazon had it on its monthly purchase program, would love to save 15% on it! However, I was glad to find it someplace besides Green Mountain. As prime members, we can get our coffee replaced in 2 shipping days v. a week or longer over at GM. Sweet!",Positive
"We received a bar in a snack pack on a transcontinental flight with our 16 month old son.  While we thought the rest of the pack wasn't appropriate for his age, this seemed okay since, as the name implies, is just fruit. He ate the bar in less than 2 minutes!  He loved it.  Granted, our little guy is a fruit and veggie nut so this is not a problem for us, but the convenience of a bar when we are out and about is very appealing.  So we kept the wrapper and are going to purchase a box from Amazon.  Great product even for a toddler.",Positive

"I'm SO glad I gave these tuo chas a chance!!! I've recently become a huge pu-erh fan, so I've been on the lookout for great pu-erh that won't cost me a leg. I keep hearing that tuos don't usually have great quality, that often tea dust and poor quality leaves are compressed to make the ""nests"" (and yes, I've tasted those often enough to say it's true), but that's not the case here. In fact, this has become one of my favorite pu-erhs. (I've also tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021I8F60"">Rishi Tea Pu-erh Classic, 3.2-Ounce Tins (Pack of 3)</a>, which I thought was bound to be better simply because it was loose leaf, but that is not the case. I was not impressed... this one is much tastier.)<br /><br />I can get 3 huge mugs (each with a strong brew) out of 1 little tuo. The 4th one is already too watery, but the 3rd is still as strong as I like. This tea made me understand those comments about good pu-erh being ""a mouthful"", thick (I used to wonder what on earth it meant); it is like gulping milk, very interesting experience. I can't really describe the flavor, except to say that it's mellow, sweet, and very yummy. As all pu-erhs, it never gets bitter. To make this taste like heaven, I sometimes add a little bit of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N749GY"">Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, Loose Leaf Tea, 16 Ounce Bag</a> for some chocolate/vanilla/orange flavor - perfection in a cup!!!<br /><br />I was wondering how many tuos actually fit into one of these little tins... and the answer is, quite a lot of them! That was another good surprise.",Positive
Caribou Blend is my top rated. The flavor is bold and smooth with a wonderful aroma. Look forward to my cup each morning.,Positive
"I tried this product in my pursuit of the best seaweed snack for flavor and price.  This one rated higher than some, but still not the best.  First, the flavor is ok, not too fishy, and the texture while thicker than some, and a little chewy, isn't bad.  The packaging consists of 80 strips to a jar, which is convenient and you get 6 jars to an order, so the cost isn't bad.  the calories are good, you get 10 pieces to a serving, a good size and it only has 10 calories.  So 1 calorie per piece w/no fat is great.  As far as carbs go, there is less than 1 carb per 10 piece serving.  Can't beat that.  Some seaweed snacks have a carb per piece.  Overall this isn't bad, but it's still not great.  Perhaps another flavor would be better.  While some seaweed snacks are so bad, I'd never try another flavor, this one is worth checking out a little more.",Neutral
This was the best value that I found online. Received my product quickly and evertything was in order. I'll definitely order from this company again because the dried hibiscus flowers were full and looked great. Can't wait to make the Caribbean drink known as sorrel!,Positive
"I've been a connoisseur of fine tea for many years.  Yet, I can no longer afford to frequent the fine tea rooms and tea stores that I used to, which offered my favorite varieties and international brands.  Subsequently, I've had to settle for lessor quality brands sold in most major supermarkets.<br /><br />Knowing how much I enjoy superior tea, my daughter-in-law chose Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a holiday gift.  I could not have been more pleased!  *I regret that I delayed writing this review. Yet, with Mother's Day approaching, I'm hoping for another gift set.<br /><br />Bentley's Royal Green Tea is a superb collection of fine tea which is equal in quality and taste to some of the world's best green tea I've enjoyed.  This elegantly wrapped gift-set offers 6 varieties of special blends of green tea and fruit blends, from exotic fruits to popular favorites, such as Mango or Raspberry.<br /><br />Each teabag is securely sealed in a beautifully designed packet, with an elegant artistic image representing the fruit which flavors that teabag.  Bentley's goes further by providing a sturdy wood-like case, designed with 6 separate sections, each section containing 6 teabags of one flavor.  This solid well-designed dark-green case holds a total of 36 individually wrapped tea bags in its six compartments; a case which aptly resembles a jewelry box for the true 'jewels' of exquisite fine teabags it holds.  Indeed, when you lift the firm lid on this elegant case of fine tea, you will know you have a treasure-chest of great varieties of fine green tea.<br /><br />I was especially impressed that each teabag was expertly measured and prepared to effect the perfect aroma and optimal taste for the average teacup.  No other green teabags comes close to the perfect brew one would expect from the finest loose tea sold in specialty tea stores and tea rooms.<br /><br />Whether you purchase Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a gift, or for your personal use, you will not be disappointed by the suburb quality of this wonderful selection of fruit-flavored green tea.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />April 2, 2012",Positive

"This drink is a nice blend of juices (mostly orange) and carbonated water.  There are no other ingredients.

I've tried a handful of other brands of French Roast and I find this one and Tully's version to be both great and comparable in flavor. The difference is the price (this one is far more reasonable).,Positive
"Should have known better, if it seems too good to be true....  Then, well you know.  Bought the coffee at a reduced price and was hoping to have stumbled onto a great product.  Not the case, this coffee taste like instant.  For being a dark roast, the flavor or the lack of is extremely poor.  Better luck next time......",Negative
"I compare this to drinks I've had from Starbucks and Java Monster, and I have to say that this one is the most delicate taste, has the least aftertaste, and best serving size. The downsides are that the calories per ounce are quite a bit higher than the other options, and the mouth texture feels a bit oily or emulsified if you don't drink it over ice.<br /><br />If wanting the overall best experience, surprisingly I would reach for the Java Monster-- best value, taste and calorie per ounce ratio. For the most aggressive coffee taste, I choose the Starbucks. And for the least aftertaste, and quick on the go drink, I choose this one.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee expert, so I'm not sure if that emulsified or egg white emulsified mouth experience is normal or expected, but for me, if that could be minimized or eliminated I would really appreciate this product more. I rated 3 stars out of 5 because of the emulsified mouth experience and the less desirable calories per ounce.",Neutral
"I bought these after I switched to eating all whole grains as an alternative to regular egg noodles.  They taste fine but they're really nothing special.  The noodles are also pretty narrow and I had hoped for something wider.  My biggest complaint though was how several of the bags (I think it was 4) popped open during shipping and I ended up throwing them out since I didn't want to use a product from an opened bag.  If they had a better way to ship these they might be worth buying again but as for me, I'm going to try to find another whole wheat egg noodle.",Neutral
"PROS:<br />Added sweetness without the added carbs<br />No effects on insulin levels<br />Safe for diabetics<br />Handy 1 g packages<br />0 calories<br />Organic<br /><br />CONS:<br />Sweet, but with a different overall taste than sugar<br />Bitter aftertaste is not completely eliminated<br />The bitter aftertaste is accentuated by the amount of product used--the more you add, the more you get the aftertaste<br />Fine grained, non-sugar like powder<br />Expensive<br /><br />OTHER NOTES:<br />Packaged for sweetening beverages, not for baking (not bulked up enough to be used on its own)<br />A single package is supposed to be equal to '2 tsp of sugar,' but this really depends on your own individual taste<br /><br />Trying to decrease the amount of empty carbs in my diet, I purchased Wholesome Organic Stevia from another vendor.  I have never really been a fan of stevia before, but I have used Wholesome Sweeteners' products before and after reading the written-on-the-box statement that they had developed the 'Best Tasting Stevia in the World,'  I decided to give stevia one more try.  I can't say that this product blew me away or has made me love stevia, but as stevia products go this one ain't bad.  It compares fairly with other stevia brands that I have used in the past. I found that it made a reasonable sweetener for coffee and tea, so long as I was careful not to use too much.  (Use too much and that well-known, bitter aftertaste really shoots through.)<br /><br />Stevia is an all natural sweetener that is promoted as a substitute for table sugar (sucrose).  There are any number of brands and different forms in which stevia is sold.  Popular formulations of stevia include highly concentrated liquid extracts and powdered forms, such as the stevia sold here.  Stevia is often mixed with other substances to bulk it up and to help hide stevia's well known bitter aftertaste.  In the case of the Wholesome Sweeteners product, the stevia is mixed with organic agave inulin and silica.<br /><br />In its natural form stevia leaves are something like 30 to 45 times the sweetness of table sugar, but the purified forms of stevia can be up to 250 to 300 times sweeter than sugar.  Commercial stevia is usually an extract from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, and, in this light, the Wholesome Sweeteners product is no exception.  The difference in commercial compounds is usually not the source of the stevia but rather the final purity/composition of the extract and how the stevia is extracted.  According to what I have read, the sweetness of the stevia is mostly derived from something called rebaudioside A, the major component 'steviol glycoside' that lends the sweetest taste to stevia with the least amount of bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Companies may argue about the proper way to derive and purify their stevia extracts, but the major deciders,of course, are your own taste buds.  Let me just warn you:  do NOT attempt to taste test this (or any) stevia directly out of the package.  If you apply stevia directly to your tongue, you will be overwhelmed by the initial sweetness of the stevia and then majorly turned off by the awful, bitter aftertaste.  Stevia needs to be mixed into a larger volume (such as an 8 or 12 ounce cup of coffee) before it is sampled.<br /><br />When mixed into a cup of coffee, the Wholesome Sweeteners brand compared favorably to other brands of stevia that I have used.  The sweetness was certainly there, but is not exactly the same as table sugar.  For me, stevia has a more cotton-candy like sweetness that you may or my not prefer and for some odd reason it seemed more pronounced in the back rather than the front of my mouth (I don't have a good explanation for this, but for some reason it seems so).  I am okay with this kind of sweetness, but I prefer xylitol and erythritol(<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X71550"">Swerve Sweetener, 16oz [1lb</a>]), which have a taste that is more similar to table sugar.  I didn't notice much of a bitter taste at first (1/2 packet in 8 ounces), but at higher concentrations (a whole packet in 8 ounces) the bitterness was definitely there.  Although it wasn't pronounced, it was disturbing enough to make drinking the coffee a less pleasant experience.  Xylitol and erythritol do exhibit a 'cooling effect' at higher concentrations that may disturb some people, but on the whole have a cleaner, more sucrose-like flavor--they taste more like sugar than the stevia does.<br /><br />On the whole, the taste was palatable at lower concentrations.  Since I'm not the kind of guy that likes to suck coffee directly through the sugar cube, this was okay for me.  But I will warn you that if you are someone who likes their coffee very sweet and you try this with stevia, you will definitely be disappointed by that bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />If you are into artificial sweeteners (we're talking taste here, not other issues), this stevia is definitely better than saccharine.  I've never really liked the taste of saccharine very much and saccharine has a much more pronounced bitter aftertaste.  In comparison to Splenda (sucralose), the stevia is probably a dead heat.  On taste alone, I'd describe Splenda's sweet taste as more similar to sugar, but I've always found the aftertaste of Splenda to be a big turn off.  At low concentrations, I'd prefer Wholesome Sweeteners' stevia, but at higher levels of sweetness, I'd prefer splenda.  Once again, on taste alone, I'd have to give a real edge to Equal (aspartame).  Equal's sweetness isn't completely sucrose-like, but it is closer to a more pure sweetness than stevia.  Equal also has a less pronounced aftertaste.<br /><br />That being said, the artificial sweeteners have their own baggage and plenty of folks avoid them.  In the natural realm of things, I prefer erythritol.  It is less sweet than sugar, but tastes more like sugar.  Erythritol also has fewer GI side effects and is lower in calories than xylitol (xylitol has 40% fewer calories than table sugar).<br /><br />Please note, that this stevia is not meant to replace sugar in baking.  Unless it is packaged with filler, it isn't bulky enough nor does it have enough sugar-like physical qualities to be a baking substitute. However, you can buy formulations of stevia that are bulked up with fillers or other sweeteners (inulin, erythritol, etc.) so that it can be used for baking.  As noted above, however, stevia has a distinct taste that may or may not work with your baked goods.<br /><br />On the whole, this isn't a bad way to go if you like the taste of stevia.  It is a reasonable choice if you like its unique, sweet taste.  For me, it tasted far better than the artificial sweeteners, saccharine and Splenda.  At lower concentrations, I found it to be a pleasant sweetener for coffee and tea and it's always nice to have another, natural sweetener to choose from.  However, I'm not ready to jump on the stevia bandwagon yet: I'll certainly finish off my box of stevia, but after that I'll be going back to my erythritol...",Neutral
"I've been eating healthy foods almost exclusively for the past 7 years, so I end up eating things like this when I need a snack.  It's whole grain and has the lowest salt content of just about any cracker-type product that I can find, i.e., it's a reasonably healthy food.  Of course, the downside is that it doesn't taste  good.  I couldn't possibly eat it plain.  Instead, I spread on some healthy (i.e., no salt, no sugar, etc.) peanut butter, homemade hummus, or homemade guacamole.  That makes for a decent (but certainly not delicious) snack.  I often wonder if all this healthy eating is worth it.",Positive

However, the amount of filling varies tremendously from piece to piece. I had some that were more filling than hard candy, while others were all hard and no filling. The yummy filling was a real crap shoot; maybe yes, maybe no. The outer hard candy was sweet with a little coffee flavor, but tasted kind of strange. Most of the coffee punch was in the filling. Coffee was 4th item on a list of ingredients that numbered 8. When the filling was plentiful=6 out of 10; when there wasn't any filling=3 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies.<br />  God bless.

"I requested this item from the Amazon Vine program and decided to have my family help me get more info for my review. I love eating healthy and was looking forward to a better alternative to the already semi-healthy granola I was enjoying. So, I sat my family down at the table. My dad, mom, two brothers, one sister and one grandmother and asked them to taste test it.<br /><br />My mom and sister were the first to protest. Now, I hadn't tried it at this point but everyone else had. My sister and mom told me it was too bland and the chocolate was too grainy. It didn't taste natural.<br /><br />My two brothers were next. My older brother (who is 28 years old) told me that the only time he would eat this would be if he was walking through the woods and hadn't eaten anything and had stumbled over it. My younger brother (22) said that while the taste wasn't awful, it ""just wasn't good either"".<br /><br />My grandmother was indifferent. She was the first person to like it a little bit even though she claimed it tasted like dry oatmeal and tiny flakes of chocolate.<br /><br />My dad said the same thing. That it tasted as if there was no chocolate in it at all and the granola had an oatmeal taste that didn't sit right with him.<br /><br />I figured that maybe they were making a fuss out of nothing so I decided to try it. In my hand it looked harmless but upon eating it, I found that I could not produce enough saliva to even slightly moisten the granola chunks and the chocolate used was horrible and crumbled in my mouth instead of melted.<br /><br />This is my very first bad review and I have to say... it deserves it. I will never purchase this item and if anyone wants the half of bag I got, it's being fed to my hampster. He happens to think it's wonderful!",Negative

Each piece is really about the size of a Starburst candy so my personal vibe was that eating a few tiny squares wouldn't be giving me any extra energy on top of all the other coffees, (diet) red bulls, and cliff bars I frequently consume.<br /><br />  They did taste pretty natural and I could taste the honey.  I might eat them again for a sweet tooth fix but at $1+ per pack and non-filling I'll probably stick to cliff bars and just secretly raid my office neighbor's starburst jar for a sweet tooth fix here and there.

"After receiving my box of Big Nuts bars from Amazon Vine, I eagerly tore into the box to get my first taste of this treat.  Expecting something more along the lines of a candy bar, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste: peanuty, definitely, with a slight sense of the granola bar that it is meant to imitate. They are not overpoweringly sweet, but the second and third ingredients in the label are sugar and corn syrup. At 220 calories a pop, they could easily be diet killers, including the 22 g of carbs each medium sized bar provides. Would I purchase these in the store? Probably not.

I don't think its anywhere near as flavorful as the other version. There is a bit of heat to it, but its not a flavorful kind of heat. The other reviewers have talked about the sodium content and I was quite shocked. Both versions have the same serving size (1 tsp) and while the Huy Fong version has 100 mg per serving (4% of daily allowance) the Roland version has 2500 mg per serving (84% of daily allowance) so steer clear if you have high blood pressure. On another nutritional note, The Huy Fong version has 5 cal/tsp while the Roland version has 100 cal/tsp, so definitely not low calorie...<br /><br />Overall, if you had to choose between the two, I would definitely go for the original sriracha made by Huy Fong foods. It has more flavor and is much healthier for you!",Neutral

"I will start with some helpful info..<br /><br />-Nespresso machine: Pixie<br />-Ne-Cap capsules 100 pcs. ($23.29)<br />-Coffee: Lavazza - Crema e Gusto 250g enough for 50 capsules ($5.75)<br />-Empty capsule weight: ~1 gram<br />-Filled capsule weight: ~6 grams<br />-One capsule preparation time: 60-70 secs<br />-Cost of filled capsule: ~$0.35<br /><br />The main reasons for purchasing the refill capsules are, being able to enjoy the coffee I like and save some money.<br /><br />I haven't encountered any troubles with the capsules EXCEPT that you dont get the best out of it, as most of the hot water is spilled into the used capsules container; although I had the capsules filled, pressed and sealed appropirately. Therefore, I had to reuse the same capsule, however, sometimes replaced it with another one. The reason of water spill/waste is that Ne-Cap capsules are shorter than Nespresso capsules. Thus I assume if they were the same size, the capsules will perform much better.<br /><br />This option is somehow economical, nevertheless, sometimes you may need to use two capsules to enjoy your Espresso, or Cappuccino cup.<br /><br />Conclusion, if you are not enjoying the taste of Nespresso flavours or you like to have your own ground coffee, and want to save some $$$, go for it..BUT dont expect the same performance and cleanness of Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />Update 2/8/2012================<br /><br />When I first used the Ne-Caps, I gave it 3 stars. After using almost 30 capsules, I got to believe that it's not worth it and that Nespresso capsules are irreplaceable. I tried all possible ways to enhance the performance of the capsules, I made more holes at the base, also I dilated the existing ones, but all my attempt were useless. The shape of Ne-Cap pods should be modified to look like nespresso ones. That way, I believe they would be better. So my advice is to stick to nespresso despite the price. Save yourself the time and headache and enjoy your easy, tasty coffee.",Negative
"Over half of the calories in this come from added sugar. While oatmeal is healthy for you, Quaker dumps a ton of sugar in to these things to make them palatable. 19g of sugar to be exact.

I've only used it a couple of times and see no advantage over the more readily available Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up salt.

They have about 40 percent more calories than you'd get with a Hershey's, but they also taste better.  I wish the squares for breaking off pieces were smaller, because this is really nibbling chocolate, not something you'd eat a whole bar of in a single sitting.<br /><br />I wouldn't say these are special or extraordinary chocolate bars.

"I tried 3 flavors (Cherry Berry, Orchard Blend and Tropical Blend) and found the following to be true of all of them.<br /><br />1) Packaging is impressive with long, narrow, foil lined one-serving sized bags. However, the size of the bag is deceiving for the amount of product inside. Although they are easy to open by simply tearing off the top inch, they are not resealable - not that you would want to because the servings are so 'small'. The bag design also makes it near to impossible to reach in by hand for snacks. Even a child's hand is too large, resulting in having to eat this snack by pouring into hand or bowl.<br /><br />2) At the bottom of each bag is a layer of fine 'powder' residue from the dried fruits. It gets on everything and stains: esp. when wet from fingers, etc. It also makes it difficult to get the last of the snacks from the bag to your mouth, esp. if eating directly from the package,  because the powder from the bottom of the bag puffs out, up your nose and all over your mouth. Makes a mess.<br /><br />3) All 3 flavors that I tried had the same issue as someone mentioned in their comments before me: each flavor seems to have an over-abundance of one particular fruit. In the Cherry Berry, it is apples. In the tropical, I found it to be mangoes, and in the orchard, it was bananas, lots and lots of bananas.<br /><br />4) I also found some of the snack to be 'crunchy' while other pieces of fruit were sticky/mushy once in my mouth. Ex. banana slices. The combo of moosh and crunch (very little crunch) was disappointing when this is suppose to be a 'crunchy snack'. I found myself using it up in yogurt and oatmeal rather than as a snack.<br /><br />This is a natural snack so the first time around I didn't mind the expense. However, now that I know what to expect, I will not purchase again unless the packaging and fruit 'dust' issues could be addressed. Then it might be worth the money. Until then, I'll buy my own fresh bananas, mangoes and apples.<br /><br />I will admit, however, a few of these put together in a gift basket would make a nice presentation for someone who has never tried this product.",Neutral

It was a one-time only mistake.<br /><br />Looking at the picture of the package, and reading the description, it looked like a lot of almonds, pumpkin seeds, some sunflower seeds and berries...just like it says.  However, upon opening the first package, all I saw were sunflower seeds...lots and lots of sunflower seeds.  An average handful would be a overwhelming majority of sunflower seeds with some pumpkin seeds, maybe 2 almonds, a couple of raisins, one or two cranberries, and I'd only get a tiny blueberry or two every 3-4 handfuls.  I was really surprised.  If I had saw this mix in a clear plastic bag at the grocery store, I would think it was bird seed.<br /><br />Wondering how it got such great reviews, I read them (something I should have done prior to purchasing).  Lots of people were saying how much they love it, but not really saying anything about what was in the bag!<br /><br />As for what was there, it was OK.  I'm not sure what ""dry roasting"" is, but all of the nuts and seeds tasted raw...soft and a bit chewy.  I've got nothing against raw nuts, but since the description says ""roasted"", I expected nice, crisp almonds and seeds.  Not the case.<br /><br />If organic is your thing, then I'm sure you might like this mix for what it is.  It is healthy as well.  However, I am sticking with my Back to Nature Martha's Vineyard Blend Trail Mix...it's as cheap or cheaper (if you get it at the right time), fresh, with lots of big, chewy cherries and cranberries.<br /><br />If you look at the bag of the Back to Nature mixes, it is clear and shows you exactly what you are getting.

"My wife and I are vegetarian, and after a lot of research decided to start feeding our dog this kibble. Afterall, dogs can clearly survive on vegan diets, as long as they are nutritionally balanced. The whole time she appeared fine, and there were no issues with lethargy, or fur. However, after a few months she started having uncontrolable diharrea, and loads of gas.  After a lot of vet bills and testing we were left with the suggestion to try a different food.<br /><br />So we did a 180 degree turn, and bought a no-grain high-protein food (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZNW346"">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food, Duck Recipe, 24-Pound Bag</a>). The bottom line, is that now she seems to be doing much better.  At the end of the day we never figured out what it was about the veggie food that upset her bowels, but changing food solved the problem. We are not super militant vegetarians, so this wasn't the end of the world for us.  Our mantra is minimize.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me; I've read many good things about this veggie kibble, and there are many stories of people feeding their dog this food for many years with no problems.  So, by all means try it out.  I'm glad we did, and in all honesty I wish we could keep feeding it.

"These were a surprising flop as far as my indoor cat and a neighbor's visiting cat. Initially I thought it was our Kitty being finicky as she tends to be, but when the neighbor's omnivorous cat similarly ignored these flakes I puzzled over what was up with them. I've bought other brands before and have encountered one hit and one other miss. What makes some appealing to the cats and others not is a mystery. I couldn't see any visible difference and the scent seemed appropriately fishy, but something did not strike a chord with the cats. Wish I hadn't sprung for this economy sized bag.",Negative
"My family and I tried the Sparkling Blackberry and we all agreed that it was good, but not great.  It's better than drinking a soft drink since the sugar content comes from the fruit juice and isn't artificial.  It's sort of like having a carbonated fruit juice -- they take sparkling water and add fruit juice (70% fruit juice is what the can says).  The cans are small, perfect to pack in a lunch for your kids.  The price of Izze is a little steep, especially since they're good...not great.",Neutral

"This cereal reminds me of frosted mini wheats. When eaten without milk, it is not too sweet but is still sweet enough to avoid being bland. It's crunchy, and I can definitely taste the cinnamon. Unfortunately, once milk is added, the not being too sweet part became a disadvantage. I usually complain about foods being too sweet, but this time the sugar got diluted by the milk and the cereal became a bit bland. I would only buy this if you're planning on eating it without milk added or if you want to add extra flavoring to your cereal.",Neutral

Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew. My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken, turkey and salmon varieties. Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots, peas and green beans, but he does eat them. I really like that Spot's Stew is an all natural cat food with no by-products or fillers, and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys.",Positive
"We needed some way to train our very large dog to stay away from our neighbor's chain link fence, so she would not climb over, and to keep her out of our vegetable garden. Someone suggested this kind of above ground electric fence.<br />After looking around on the Internet and searching unsuccessfully for a place where we could buy the supplies locally, I ordered this kit from Amazon. As usual, the service from Amazon was great, and the price was good.<br />The kit is easy to install, although 100 feet of wire is not really that much. We were able to buy additional wire at a local hardward store. The support poles are a little flimsy. and also a little too short for a part of our area. We ended up supplementing them with a few pieces of 1/2"" PVC pipe, so in order to get everything we needed, we ended up spending close to $100.<br />The wire has done its job, though. So far the dog has been too suspicious of it to go near it.",Neutral
"This was actually a surprisingly refreshing drink that is lighter then OJ and reminds me of a virgin Mimosa. There was little after taste and the flavor isn't overbearing like an orange soda.

Overall, a good, refreshing pick me up, but you may want to drink more then one.",Positive

"I tried the Honey Stinger Orange Blossom Energy chews while training for my first marathon.  I had tried energy gels first but didn't like them because the packaging always cut my lips, I could never eat the whole package at one time, and they always caused a sticky mess.  The energy chews tasted better and were less messy.  They were still a little sticky, but manageable.  The energy gels gave me a much more noticeable boost in energy, though.  I also disliked the packaging of the Honey Stinger chews because it was too difficult to open while running.  The top of the bag is too thick and the force needed to tear it open would cause the rest of the bag to tear and make the chews explode out of the bag.  I ended up just cutting open the bag beforehand and putting the chews in a Ziploc bag.  I got the Clif Shot Blok chews at the marathon expo and thought they tasted slightly better.  All of the chews and gels I have looked at have been overpriced.",Neutral

"This is a direct response to the misleading, non-sensical review that starts with the headline: ""No Bargain"":<br /><br />First off, the ""No Bargain"" review is EXTREMELY MISLEADING.<br /><br />Here's the two things the reviewer got right: 1) If you DO have the Fancy Feast cases delivered regularly via Amazon's ""Subscribe & Save""-- you pay $14.02 a case. 2) If you buy 24 cans at Petsmart (at 53 cents per can) you pay $12.72 for a case.<br /><br />BUT HERE'S WHERE THEIR THEORY IMPLODES:<br /><br />If you buy your case at Petsmart (in CA-- specifically in Los Angeles where I live)-- YOU HAVE TO PAY SALES TAX... Adding as much as $1.24 to the total cost of a case.<br /><br />Now the Petsmart case costs $13.96. Since we've agreed that the Amazon case purchased via Amazon's ""Subscribe & Save"" costs $14.02... That means there is only a SIX CENT DIFFERENCE PER CASE between Amazon's price and California Petsmart and Walmart prices.<br /><br />Plus, you also have to PAY FOR GAS if you go to Petsmart or Walmart. Plus, the extra travel time to and fro. Plus, you have to drag all that cat food to your car from the store and then drag it from your car to your house.<br /><br />MY Amazon Fancy Feast is DELIVERED TO MY FRONT DOOR BY A UPS DELIVERY PERSON.<br /><br />I'll gladly pay a EXTRA SIX CENTS for DELIVERY TO MY DOOR.<br /><br />If folks follow your thinking-- they'll spend A LOT MORE MONEY for their cat food!<br /><br />Think it through!

My favorite that I've had is the Oregon Chai Concentrate, but decided to give Big Train a try since it had so many good reviews.<br /><br />Upon having my first cup, I wondered if there was something wrong with the chai I had received, either that or my opinion on a good chai varies wildly from everyone else!  It tastes kind of chalky, especially when you get to the bottom of the cup.  The flavor was also kind of strange, nothing like the sweetness that you would get from Oregon Chai.  I was wishing that I had ordered the vanilla flavor...perhaps that would have agreed more to my tastes.  I know there are a lot of people that prefer the spicy flavor over the sweet flavored chais.  Perhaps this brand is tailored to the spicy chai lovers.<br /><br />I've had the two cans for a few months now, and have been drinking it as a last resort when I am out of my other chai.  I have ordered the vanilla Big Train chai to see if that has a better taste.

"I found these Frosted Flakes to be good but as compared to what comes from the local grocery store the flakes from Amazon had a different color and taste. I received the flakes in a timely manner and they still had almost a year left before reaching the Best Used by Date, but these had a look and taste as if they had already passed the expiration date. The coloring was considerably darker and they seemed to have lost their sweet taste.  They are still edible and I am eating them.",Neutral
Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!,Negative

"I love Kitchens of India and have ordered many of their mixes (esp. the butter chicken curry mix) and ready-to-eat items, but was very disappointed in this one.<br /><br />There is very little rice compared with the amount of grease and spices (strong taste of pumpkin pie spices like cinnamon and clove) and it just doesn't taste very good. The 8.8 oz package says it is two servings but is really only one serving -- and has TWENTY FOUR GRAMS OF FAT, 10 of them Saturated Fat, and 580 calories. I did enjoy the free Indian music CD, but that comes with their other food items as well.  Pass this one up!",Negative
"The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. How does this accompanying Strong Lengths conditioner hold up?<br /><br />FRAGRANCE<br /><br />Similar to cheap children's perfume.  While it is not overpowering, I think a simple ""clean"" smell would be much better.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br /><br />The texture is thick and it takes a lot to spread throughout long hair.<br /><br />CONDITIONING<br /><br />The name suggests that this is a lighter conditioner than the Dry Scalp type, and that seems to be the case.  My hair was soft, but something heavier might be needed during the winter.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />Clear Strong Lengths conditioner is very reminiscent of a generic conditioner, with a cheap floral scent and basic results.  If you are a fan of the Clear shampoos, I suggest looking elsewhere for the conditioner.",Neutral

"These PB2 products are definitely a low calorie alternative if you are willing to give up some of the flavor and texture that you get with original PB. I wasn't a big fan of the regular PB flavor as it was just too different for me from regular PB, and I only used reduced fat PB normally as well. I enjoyed the chocolate flavor a bit better than the regular.<br /><br />Also, it should be noted that because you mix 2 tablespoons of the powder with a tablespoon of water, this actually creates probably half of a jar of PB in the end so this regular sized PB jars go much more quickly.<br /><br />All in all, I'm not sure I will be purchasing this product again. The grainy texture and difference in flavor, along with the fact that you have to do measuring and mixing to get your PB is just not worth it to me. I'll take reduced fat PB.",Neutral
I like this flavor a lot. When I make this I add about 1/4-1/2 cup of regular old fashioned oats. It makes it not quite so sweet and I like the texture of the non-instant oats.

If I wanted oil from gene modified soybeans I could run down to Dollar General and get a lot larger bottle for $1.  Of course I'd have to crush a garlic clove or 2 to flavor it, but at least I'd know that it was actual garlic in it rather than the ""garlic extracts"" that Roland uses to flavor their soybean oil.

It's smooth and delicious. To me, it tastes like soy milk and the hemp ingredients are not detectable. It goes great in coffee.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of, however, is the health claims of the product. The carton touts the high omega-6 content of this product and even shows a bar graph comparing it to soy milk and almond and rice milk. This product contains beneficial Omega-3 as well (found in things like fish oil an grains), but high omega-6 is not a good thing. Too much omega-6 can have negative effects on health because it is inflammatory. Most Americans already get too much omega-6 because it is very common in our diet (from plant oils). A University of Maryland Medical Center study found that Americans get 14-25x more omega-6 than omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />It is important to keep the ratio in balance, and some health researchers believe the optimal ratio is closer to 4:1 of omega-6 to omega-3 for lowering the risk for certain kinds of cancer. On PubMed, look for article ID: 12442909, ""The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids.""",Positive

"My first impression: pears mixed with green beans????? Strange.  My second impression: convenient packaging? It was not more convenient than a jar in my opinion.<br />I tasted this first and was surprised that I did not gag--I can't stand most baby foods.  It really wasn't a terrible combination and the pear taste was a little stronger than the bean without being overwhelming.  As far as taste, the most important factor (the baby), reallyenjoyed the food.<br />I don't believe that having ""organic"" plastered all over the product should make the consumer feel safe.  The design of the product didn't bowl me over either and packaging in not biodegradeable.  I don't find this package any more convenient than traditional jars--and jars can be recycled.  In fact, once a baby is eating more (finishes a jar), the jar is more convenient since the baby can be fed directly from the jar.  IF hot water is available, a jar can be placed in it as easily as the pouch in order to warm the food.",Neutral

"I have loved the Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy caffeine free tea for as long as I can remember.  For some reason, Safeway and Trader Joes stopped selling it, so I ordered 12 boxes from Amazon.  Before ordering, I noticed they had changed the box design, but also noticed the new box said, ""New Look, Same Great Taste"", so I felt I would get the same great tea I have loved for many years.  Not the case!!!  The tea tastes very different from the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy tea I love.  When I called Good Earth to speak to someone about this, the customer service representative told me there was no change made to the tea, but new packaging.  I told him that couldn't be true and he finally told me that they have added artificial sweeteners and flavors to the Good Earth tea that comes in the new packaging.  He said if I wanted to get the tea I was used to tasting, I would need to buy the 25 count tea box not the 18 count box.  This doesn't make any sense to me at all, but I wanted to let Amazon customers know how to get the tea that they have come to love from Good Earth.

Most biter biscuits are for twelve months and older. Before ten months of age, my babies had some trouble with pieces getting broken off into their mouths and choking. Now, they eat these like pros. It takes some experience, time and close supervision. Gerber biter biscuits are less messy because they crumble easier instead of getting sloppy.

I don't really have a sensitive scalp, but I do have a scalp that likes to get a good scratch now and again.

I don't know why I had my mind made up that it would be, but when it came out and wasn't, there was a sense of let down which leads me to believe that it's still just a bunch of chemicals I'm putting on my head.<br /><br />Since I was fortunate enough to have both the shampoo and conditioner at the same time, I will also say that I'm not a fan of the product packaging.

"The first thing I do when Iam trying or thinking about trying a new product is look at the ingredients, at least I can do that in a store, where I can see the product up close.  Online you may get the general idea, which is open to interpretation.<br /><br />I've never had an energy drink before, or any energy product besides 5 hour energy.  With that, which I have only tried that once, was if I drank the whole bottle, tho it is small it may have given me energy, but I didn't feel very good, until it wore off.<br /><br />This product, No Fear, which I had to turn the can around to even see what it was called, it's a 16 ounce can, which is supposed to be 2 servings.  On the front of the can it says super energy supplement.<br /><br />I took a few sips.  It tastes like grapefruit, so the taste isn't bad.  It's kind of refreshing.<br /><br />Then I read the ingredients on the back of the can.  What I saw amazed me!!<br /><br />Calorie wise it's 130 calories, but what really surprised me is the amount of carbohydrates, it's 34 grams, but the sugar is 33 grams, and both of those are for ONE serving!<br /><br />I wonder if the real energy you are getting is because of all of the sugar that is in this product!<br /><br />The caffeine level is 87 mg's, so I don't know how much that computes to when you are considering the amount of caffeine, what differentiates a high caffeine level versus a low caffeine level.  I suspect that this drink is on the higher end of the spectrum as far as the caffeine level.<br /><br />I just wonder if the can shows it's for 2 servings, what if you don't want to drink the whole can at once, which is 16 ounces?  If you saved the other half of the can, just like soda, which first has fizz when you open the can, if you have some left over it won't have the fizz.<br /><br />Iam really not sure who would want to drink this product or why, but for me, just the amount of carbohydrates and sugars would make this a drink I could never consider drinking.<br /><br />At least for me, this is NOT a healthy drink!  Maybe if your main concern is having more energy it may not matter to you, but at what cost?<br /><br />I would be curious to see how someone would feel who had drank this whole can of No Fear.<br /><br />What they should fear is getting diabetes, especially if they drank this on a regular basis!",Negative

"Several months ago, I switched to a plant-based diet. In an effort to eat enough foods that provide protein, I've been buying Eden organic no salt added kidney beans for a simple and delicious salad made of these beans (rinsed thoroughly and drained) combined with frozen Bird's Eye corn (I use the individual Steam Fresh packet), lots of diced organic celery for crunch, two tablespoons of Goya extra virgin olive oil and Alessi white balsamic vinegar. I have found that adding the vinegar to individual servings when ready to serve has a better taste than mixing it into the entire salad during preparation. I'd like to say that this is the first time in my life that I have eaten kidney beans and didn't know what I was missing (and I am 82 years old!)I keep this salad in the fridge, and have it as a side dish twice a day.<br /><br />Another food that I didn't know existed is Eden Red Inca Quinoa. Another absolutely amazing food that can be added as a nutritious protein boost to just about everything. I add it to pasta sauce for extra body; Amy's organic low in sodium soups that I dilute and add wild rice blend and the quinoa, as well as anything else that I can think of along the way.

"I like the MIO idea, that you can flavor water a little or a lot, but basically stay hydrated w/o adding calories or a lot of other stuff to your drink.<br /><br />As far as the success of this particular flavor, I can't say it really delivers the sweet tea experience.  Its just a tad on the bland side, and that's after putting quite a few splashes in.<br /><br />But I might be spoiled in that regard, my wife is from South Carolina and makes the real deal here and there.<br /><br />The idea is great, and its a decent price when compared to the bottles of vitamin water, etc. but this flavor wasn't my favorite.<br /><br />p.s.

"if you consider that we're suppose to drink 8+ cups of water a day and each serving (if mixed w/ recommended proportions), you'd get 480 mg of caffine. that's way over recommended levels.<br />the flavor is fine, but also tangy. it mixes easily enough, seems to mix very well and doesn't seperate as far as i can tell, also, this drink contains b vitamins (which is what energy drinks use to make the caffine more efficient).<br /><br />The caffine content is on the label (60mg/serving), in the fine print under the nutritional facts. The label does mention caffine on the front, but it isn't clearly labeled, they put it in the fine print!<br /><br />I would have given this four stars if any of these were true: the caffine content was better displayed, if it had less caffine, if it wasn't so tangy, if they clearly labeled a warning / caution about the high levels of caffine / serving.<br /><br />If you decide you need flavor in your water and find yourself drinking huge gulps because you think: it's mostly water and you think it's healthy to drink huge ammounts of water, then don't use the recommended mix proportions. each cup of water  contains a lot of caffine, this drink isn't meant to be a ""gulped"" drink, it should be thought of as similar to coffee. limit your daily intake of this! and don't drink this in the evening hours! it's caffine + b vitamins. you'll probably ruin your sleep schedule if you drink this hours before you're supppose to sleep. it is more of an energy drink, not a refreshment.<br /><br />the first time i tried this, i mixed a full pitcher, 1/2 gallon or about 8 cups, without realizing how much caffine it had (i actually didn't know it had any, i thought the ""energy"" in the title was part of the name of the flavor) and it made me very jittery throughout the day. I feel this experience was partially my fault and partially the label's fault, it should have done a better job stating the important info, but i technically should have read the entire package (and the included manual, haha) before i decided to try it.

"I tried the Peanut Butter variety of Oreo Fudge Cremes, and they are definitely delicious- and RICH! When I first opened the pack, I was a little disappointed by what looked like a very meager number of cookies in the 11.3-ounce package.  The recommended serving size is 3 cookies.  Now, with a regular Oreo, I laugh at the regular serving size and proceed to obliterate an entire package in one or two sittings sometimes.  So I was ready to yell ""What a rip-off, Oreo!"" and be done with it.<br /><br />Then I tried a cookie.  I expected the fudge on the outside to be a little waxy and not very flavorful.  That's not the case with the Oreo Fudge Creme.  That fudge flavor was almost overpowering as I popped the whole cookie in my mouth - they're small enough to do that!  Then came the crunch of the thin Oreo, and the distinctive Oreo creme texture but VERY potent peanut butter flavor of the filling.  Imagine a piece of peanut butter creme pie with an Oreo crust exploding in your mouth, and that's close to the experience of these cookies.<br /><br />Back to my initial impression that Oreo's ripping us all off, putting so few of these cookies in a package.  People, it's a public service that they don't put more in.  At first I'd scoffed at the serving size, and while I had to try two of these cookies in pretty rapid succession (a conditioned response to an open package that says ""Oreo"" on it), I admit as I ate the third, I was slowed down considerably, more to a civilized three-bite per cookie pace.  That's when the richness and sugariness of the first two started hitting me.  I poured a glass of milk and enjoyed the rest of the third cookie, and had a fourth out of obligation to the remainder of my milk, and have decided that's the way to enjoy the Fudge Cremes- at least the Peanut Butter flavor- with a glass of milk.  I'd still rather have a package of original Oreo Cookies, or Double-Stufs, but I do like that the Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes encourage drinking a glass of milk, and I do think that three of them is quite a generous serving if you're enjoying a glass of milk and taking the time to enjoy each bite, instead of wolfing down a handful.  They're a fun treat I think even Cookie Monster would approve of... in moderation.",Neutral

I have tried a bunch of different energy drinks from various companies and they are all pretty similar.  Lots of caffeine, Vit B, guarana, and similar ingredients.  There effectiveness depends on individuals' resistance to these stimulants.  I drink several cups of coffee and/or energy drinks a day so the effects are there but minimal compared to my wife who is smaller and will only have an occasional cup of tea or coffee.  She drinks one of these and is bouncing off the walls.  For me it comes down to taste and I am not a fan of this flavor.  I would also choose a no- or low-calories version.",Neutral

"I'm glad I bought one box of the Mashed Sweet Potatoes before buying a 12 pack of it from Amazon. My daughter made the mashed sweet potatoes following the box directions. The sweet potatoes looked just like the picture on the box. Looks can be deceiving though:  the Betty Crocker Mashed Sweet Potatoes had a funky texture and a bad after taste. I ate my serving and told my daughter she did an excellent job preparing the potatoes as I didn't want to hurt her feelings. In truth, this is a very poor product and not up to Betty Crocker's normally high standards of prepared food mixes.<br /><br />Two star rating based on ease of preparation.<br /><br />Do not recommend.",Negative

"I've always enjoyed Bakery on Main gluten-free cereals, and was excited to find this product because it is more like ""real"" granola and healthier than many of the alternatives.

The berries taste, well, fake because they are freeze-dried (at least the strawberries are, and those are the only berries I taste), rather than simply dried like the fruit they use in their other products.<br /><br />Overall, if they put some work into this product I'd be happy to try it again, but if it remains this way, I'm unlikely to try another batch.",Negative

"I purchased this gift basket for my wife as a valentine's day gift. The fragrance after just opening the Amazon box was delightful and everything was organized well. There are two primary reasons I am displeased with this item. First, the container appeared in the photo to be a hard, durable basket made of some material at least resembling stone. With that hope, I looked forward to being able to use the container as a decorative bowl on an end table or in the kitchen. However, the container I received was no more than cardboard, easily bent and hardly more decorative than the Amazon box that it was shipped in. With this considered, we come to my second issue with this item...the price. This item is roughly $20-$25 overpriced in my opinion. With a nice stone-like container this item could pretty easily bring the $65 I've paid for it.<br /><br />Now, a few bits of information to be fair to the seller:<br />1. I am a man, not an expert in bath soaps and bathing utensils, and am not familiar with retail pricing of each individual product contained within the basket. All I know is that it costs me under $5 for a bottle of Old Spice Body Wash and a couple more dollars for a wash cloth.<br />2. I must reemphasize, once more, I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN PRICING of women's bathing products.<br />3. I won't be giving my wife the basket until Valentine's Day tomorrow, and her reaction is what really reveals the true value of the basket.",Neutral

I don't know if this isn't aged, if it comes from inferior trees, or it's something else in how it's processed (or a combination of all of them), but this doesn't even begin to compare with the wonderfully complex and slightly pungent ""real"" Pu-erh that I've been drinking for the last twenty or so years.

"Thin, tasteless and boring. That pretty much describes this sauce (and the other sauces by this brand). It's so bad I'm shocked that Mario Batali put is name on this!<br /><br />The Pros: The sauce has a nice color and a nice texture with some chunkier peices in it.<br /><br />The Cons: The sauce is tasteless and in between the chunkier bits it doesn't cling well to the pasta. You can see bits of garlic, onion in the sauce but the flavor has been completely boiled out of it to point that all that's left the bitter part of the garlic and the acidic part of the tomatoes. To say the flavors don't blend is an understatement. There aren't any flavors to blend in the first place.<br /><br />I would be embarrassed to be Mario Batali right now. Obviously he has traded his expertise and food quality for the money making machine.<br /><br />I severed this my boyfiend and we all agreed it wasn't a good sauce and would rather eat pasta plain than suffer through this sauce again.

The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are), so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect. Pairing sweet to sweet is key.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this flavor, so I will surely look into the other flavors available, most likely the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">watermelon strawberry</a> since I'll probably get a similar taste.

"I transitioned my dogs into this food. They are both under 15 pounds. They ate it eagerly, like they do with any other new food, but over time, I noticed they both seemed to be getting less and less healthy. It was so gradual that my husband and I both didn't really notice until about a month into the new food. They continued to eat it and around the 5th week, they both started getting diarrhea here and there. But my maltese continued to get sicker and sicker. She lost so much weight that her back resembled a stegasaurus, all of a sudden. She no longer had energy to run around and play any longer. She would lay on her bed listlessly and watch me instead of frolicking around, like she usually does. It was so sad. We left for a vacation and left my dogs with a friend with this food. At this point, we were suspicious that the food might have something to do with it, but we weren't positive there was a correlation. But when we got back, I had definite confirmation with my FRIEND'S dog, who ate plenty of their kibble. Her dog (16 year old beagle) was having diarrhea and vomitting while we were away.<br /><br />I have no proof that it was the food as I threw it all in the trash the moment I came back from vacation. But if it were still in my possession, I would definitely send it away for analysis and let the company know that we would definitely NOT ever take a step towards anything their company makes ever again.<br /><br />I urge you to stay away from this food, and if you do decide to take a chance with it, proceed with extreme caution, and keep the original bag so you can let the company know the batch number should any problems arise.

However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.

"Bought this item 4/11 which was made in Japan. Simply Extraordinary. My wife and I liked it so much I bought 6 more cases (8/11) but this batch is made in Thaland. The bottle is slightly diferrent, without the green leaf emblem on the front as pictured. This new version is absolutely inferior to the original ones I had. Don't get me wrong, it is still good but I would not buy it even at the discounted price currently offered on Amazon. I have read other reviewers who suggested they changed the formula. Whatever it is, it tastes  strong like the regular cheap tea I usually get at the Chinese restaurants and the after taste is completely different. I almost wanted to return the shipment but didn't want to go through the hassles. Buyers beware<br /><br />Update 7/14/12:<br />I saw a comment from other buyer that he/she received a Japan made batch. I went ahead and ordered 2 cases. Sure enough, they are now Made in Japan. The interesting thing is this batch tasted ""watered down"", exactly like another reviewer said!!! I now understand what he/she meant. Bottom line: there is definitely some quality consistency issue here (at least post Tsunami time). It is batch dependent, facility dependent ( have seen Thailand made, Japan Made, and have seen comments about Hawaii Made!). Good luck to all who seek good tea.

Don't get me wrong...I love pasta and I consume it quite regularly. So when I suddenly switched to this new gluten free diet because you hear how much healthier it is, I thought I'll give it a try.<br /><br />First off, expect to cook the spaghetti longer then regular wheat pastas. The water will start to look thick and cakey. I suppose that's normal too. As you cook beware of the odor which I can't describe. The noodles will be very sticky so I advise putting in olive oil in the water but that didn't do the trick as well as I thought either. The noodles do have a heavier consistancy but as for the taste...it was just ok. It made me quite bloated after eating it. Wonder what that was about. Would I eat this again? No.",Negative

"Have no fear, you CAN eat cereal that tastes just like those sweet cereals you ate as a kid without incurring the derision of spying neighbors. No more do you have to hide your Cinnamon Toast Crunch or Cookie Crisp in a Cheerios box, just buy these!<br /><br />(After finishing the box, I remember the cereal it tastes like: King Vitamin!)<br /><br />All kidding aside, this is a good (but not great) sweet cereal. Biggest plus is total lack of HFCS (high fructose corn syrup). This is sweetened with molasses and sugar. It is not too sweet and it is nicely crunchy. And like most fortified breakfast cereals it contains 25% of a lot of the vitamins you need daily.<br /><br />It's not a great source of protein or fiber. But on the flip side, it's not carb heavy or high in calories (for what it is). And to be honest, there's no great nut taste even if peanuts are the 4th ingredient. And I don't get honey from it either.<br /><br />So to wrap up: sweet crunch: yes. great nutrition: no. Probably not worth 7$+ a box, but it is probably cheaper at your grocery store.

"My whole family--especially the eight-year-old--loves these wide rice noodles (chow fun). They are not easy to find outside of a Chinese market, so buying in bulk is a good idea. I love the mouth-feel of rice noodles anyway, and wide is just that much more fun. Plus, they are not flimsy (like rice vermicelli), so are easy to stir-fry. I use a simple Cantonese style, with some soy sauce, some oyster sauce, and a little beef stock. Be sure to use plenty of oil when you stir-fry, as the noodles do absorb it. But your dish will be so beautiful, it's so worth it. Lastly, if you are on a no-gluten diet, you are gonna go ga-ga over these!<br /><br />The directions on the package for presoaking are good--but instead of warm tap water (which has more lead in it from the pipes!) use cold water and warm it in the microwave. Be sure your noodle container is large enough so that the noodles won't stick to each other too much (and you will have to stir from time to time--again, to keep them from sticking). If you have to do something else, you can store the partially softened, drained noodles in the fridge--they'll be fine when you get back. Then saute as usual. Serve quickly so that the noodles don't get mushy. Voila! A fabulous and easy meal with minimal work (just a little advance effort).",Positive

"When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562"">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422"">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!!

"I saw Eight O'Clock coffee, whole-bean unground, 11 ounce bag for $4 at the local grocery store chain, aka HEB(it's a big one, here in Texas).  I was blown away!  I recognized the name as something of a throwback from decades past, probably my grandmother would remember this coffee brand, and at this price, it was worth a gamble.  I bought four of them.<br /><br />My motto is, how bad can you screw up the coffee, if you can grind the whole beans yourself, and the beans haven't been sitting there for a couple of years?  Even the cheapest coffee, if roasted minimally and ground fresh by me, tastes better then the most expensive coffee, that is pre-ground, sitting on a shelf for a few months.  There is no comparison, fresh ground always crushes, pun not intended, pre-ground.<br /><br />So back to this Eight O'Clock whole-bean coffee I got on sale.  I use my electric grinder, which is the typical handheld electric grinder, and I top it off with the Eight O'Clock beans, which is the normal amount, grind it, and throw it in my french coffee press, add the nearly boiling water, press it, and pour myself a cup.  Oh yea, I add heavy whipping cream, instead of half and half, because I'm watching my carbs.<br /><br />What can I say? Coffee is great.  It's different from the Starbucks burnt flavor, cause I have Starbucks wholebean as well.  Eight O'Clock has a hint of sweetness, I'm pretty sure that several local restaurants must use Tata for coffee, because it has a similar flavor.  It's obvious that it's not as heavily roasted as Starbucks, but what is?<br /><br />Anyway, after reading the negative reviews here, I'm not sure if there's a quality control issue, a bad batch, or if there is some counterfeit coffee being sold ....whatever the problem is, I know I won't be buying this Eight O'Clock coffee online.  I trust my local grocer if  run into a bad batch to take it back.<br /><br />I'm going back tonight to buy out the rest of their Eight O'Clock.",Neutral
"I first started using Zipfizz about 2-3 years ago and enjoyed during that time period HOWEVER, I don't know if they changed something in the formula or what but now I cannot drink it without side effects. It use to give me the extra kick and energy I needed... through the morning... another through the afternoon. RECENTLY though when I drink just a small amount I get 'VERTIGO' which will last for a few days, actually causing me to miss 2 days of work. I fell ok when I am sitting or lying down, but when I stand I am dizzy and it lasts for days. Also, the muscles in the back and on the side of my neck ache, directly behind and below the back of my ears. This is still an after effect that has lasted since I first experienced this. After initially having the dizziness effect, a month later I wanted to put my theory to the test so I bought another box from my local Costco and took just a few drinks and AGAIN the same effects occurred causing me miss work. NOW I HAVE NEW INFORMATION - My 24 yr old son ( who occasionally would use Zipfizz ) has reported the same effect with his latest use of the product. This leads me to believe they have changed something... or there was ONE HUGE BAD BATCH of the stuff made somewhere. Draw your own conclusions, just my experience. Thanks, Don",Negative

In Amazon's product image above, the peanuts appear thoroughly coated in chili pepper; but, in the image I uploaded, you'll see that the peanuts now only have a light dusting of pepper and salt. So, be advised, before spending a fairly substantial amount for 108 packs of these peanuts, you should first buy a smaller quantity -- because they may not be what you expected.",Negative

I now wonder if they changed the recipe, started using unripe apricots or I mistakenly bought the wrong brand of this combo???

I did a 180 with their rich, delicious flavor, so I only buy green olives from Spain (and olive oil too!).<br /><br />I was looking forward to trying these, but sadly, I found them to be extremely salty - and not as flavorful as others I've had.They would be good for tapenade, as the previous reviewer stated, or in a pasta sauce, or any ""dish"", as they will add flavor & salt (so you can adjust the final taste), and hold up well, however, I wouldn't recommend them as a superior ""stand alone"" to eat by themselves, which was the primary reason I bought them. I got them on sale, so at least the price was reasonable.<br /><br />I took off one point each for flavor, and too much salt<br /><br />Bottom Line: Suitable for recipes, don't recommend as a stand-alone olive for appetizer/snack.",Neutral

You couldn't tell just looking at the package, only after soaking in a white bowl did I see the tiny tiny black tick-like bugs.  If you could get past the gross factor, they are easy to wash off.  However, even if that was a fluke, the noodles are inferior and are not ""glassy"" like I expected.  They must be mixing something else into them as the consistency is a mixture between glass noodles and rice noodles.  Amazon, please offer some decent noodles via the prime program.  The other good noodles come with $7 shipping charge, which is not affordable.  I guess I will be buying in a conventional store.",Negative

This Oolong is a lighter amber color,obviously depending on how much tea you use and how long it is steeped.",Neutral
"Like for many reviewers, initially this product was fantastic. Besides the smell that made me sneeze slightly, my skin became soft within a few days. I was recommending this product to everyone at that point. A few months later, I started having breakouts: I had not had any pimples in over 20 years. My skin started to itch more and more. I thought initially I was attacked by some type of microscopic bugs all over my body. It became unbearable. I finally made the connection with the soap. Smelling it was making me sneeze more and more. My skin was burning after each shower. It was as if I was washing my face and body with laundry detergent.<br />Allergies develop over time. It is often hard to make a connection with the allergens. As soon as I switched to another brand, the symptoms disappeared. I was taught in medical school that Dove is amongst the safest hypoallergenic products. This new line of products for men is to the contrary incompatible with my skin. I don't have any other allergies.I don't know if the regular white bar is still as safe as it used to be, Unilever lost my trust for ever.

Well before a week had elapsed the carton was bloated with gas. The milk got really thick like paste.

"My 7-month old son was recently diagnosed (through blood tests) with a milk allergy. He's had bad cradle cap and eczema on his face since he was about two months old. After trying MANY other formulas (Enfamil, Good Start Gentle Plus, Good Start Soy, Similac Advance, Baby's Only Soy), the doctor finally suggested going hypoallergenic. So we tried Nutramigen... he seemed okay for the first couple of minutes, then he pulled the bottle out of his mouth and gagged. I tried again... and again, he drank for a minute or two, then gagged again. Then he refused to drink any more. After reading up on hypo formulas I was expecting a bad smell, but I didn't think it'd be bad enough to make my son want to hurl!<br /><br />My son never had any problems drinking all of the other formulas; this is the only one that actually made him gag. Maybe if I had started it earlier when his tastebuds were more immature, I would've had more success. I'm hesitant to give him the Alimentum because of the high sugar content. I guess my son will just have to continue suffering with rashes until I can find a formula that works for him. :(",Negative
"The fudge is exellent and creamy, and I'd buy the product again. It has a good flavor and you can tell good ingredients were used; the hazelnuts topped it off with an enjoyable flavor - would be great with coffee. However, it arrived half-melted and in a crinkled and badly handled yellow envelope! I opened it and the box it comes in was partly crushed and the plastic dish the fudge was in was cracked and broken on the sides and I had to pick a chunk of plastic out of the fudge! I am unsure how much of this was the seller's fault and how much UPS' fault, but I am highly displeased with that aspect of the purchase. Idealy, I would think fudge that's in a thin paper box with a plastic dish in it, would go in a well-packed small box, rather than an envelope. You'd think someone had intentionally thrown it against a hard surface multiple times by the looks of it. So, all in all, fudge good, the rest is awful. I gave this 3 stars because of this. Had it of arrived in a half-way decent condition, it'd be 5 stars.",Neutral

Miracle Gro makes a good mix, at a decent ratio, which is great for growing most standard houseplants and excellent for growing from seed.<br /><br />As for the gnats:  Fungus Gnats can be found anywhere there is rot.  Don't clean your sink for a week - see those bugs?  Same thing.  They eat rot.  They cannot live in dry soil.  THE BEST PREVENTION for fungus gnats is to water with either a drip-irrigation system (plastic tubing with holes in it, hidden beneath the soil surface) or water bottom-up (water the dish under the plant, and let the soil soak the water upwards).<br /><br />The fastest and most common way to become infested is to overwater your plants.  I did this one year - we had them everywhere, in all our food, on the walls, and it was disgusting.  If you already have an infestation, try lowering the frequency of your waterings - your plants won't get dehydrated from a little less if the gnats have been happy with what they've had.  Let the soil top dry completely before you water - gnats and their young live near the top, in damp soil.<br /><br />Yes, I've seen more gnats with this than other soils.  However, that could easily have been because the batch I had had been kept more damp in the store than the other stuff.  Water less, you'll have fewer gnats.

"After researching cat food, we tried quite a few brands and flavors (Merrick, Nature's Variety, Wellness) before settling on this one.<br /><br />What I like about Weruva Chicken is the strip texture instead of paste/pate, and also the very low fat content. While it's ok for cats to eat fat, they get enough from their EVO dry food, so for their wet I prefer low fat and high protein.<br /><br />I hesitate to say our cats love it, cause if I switch to something else for 2 weeks, then back to Weruva Chicken, they forget that they like it. They seem to need 2-3 days of tough love to adjust to any food, even one they previously liked.<br /><br />I wish it was made in USA instead of Thailand, so it's not perfect.<br /><br />It's only about 160 cal/can, but this is due to very low fat, which other premium catfood makers use to boost their caloric content.",Positive

Not in a way that caffeine affects me, but in a positive way it helped me get my work done with less brain fog. My skin looked clearer and brighter without makeup on. It had zero affect on my libido.

"I was excited to purchase this product because gluten free oat bran has not been available in the US until now...gluten free oats, yes...but not oat bran.  For the past two years, I have been purchasing my gluten free oat bran from Canada and have been very pleased with the quality of the product and their customer service.  However, I thought I would try this company to minimize my shipping costs.<br />I received the product quickly; however, when I opened the plastic bag which contained the oat bran, there was a faint, but distinct, odor that I can only describe as sour milk.<br /><br />I notified the company via e-mail through their website and questioned what I might be smelling and whether I received oats that may have gone rancid.  When I did not receive an answer after a few days, I notified them again and added my complaint of poor customer service.  I received an e-mail and a telephone message assuring me that their oats were fresh and had a shelf life of another eight months.  She further explained that they were raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oats and very nutritious.<br /><br />Okay, I thought, so maybe oats that are raw, unsteamed, unprocessed and nutritious have an offensive odor. I am always open to eating foods in their most natural state.  For a few days, I ate the oat bran each morning even though it had a sour, as well as a sweet taste that I am not accustomed to.  I e-mailed the company again to let them know that the odor and taste did not seem right to me.  I asked if they would describe to me the odor of raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oats; but after a week, they have not responded.<br /><br />So either raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oat bran smells like sour milk and has a sour/sweetish taste or the oat bran that I received was rancid.

If the sample sent to me had been a medium roast I could give it a better rating, probably.  Part of the joy of the experience of drinking coffee, for me, is the smell of a freshly opened bag or can.  The fragrance of this, freshly opened, was of burnt coffee beans.  The flavor, upon making it, was of coffee made with burnt coffee beans.  But, as I say, I have this problem with any French Roast.  As far as low acidity, I think the makers are on the mark.

Each requires a slightly different time to heat completely so the first time I heat a product I watch it carefully to determine that time.<br /><br />I followed the HC directions, removing the metal lid under the plastic cover and replacing the plastic cover.  Our microwave is a relatively low wattage model (compared to the 1700 watts assumed by HC on the label) so I knew it would take longer than the 1 minute 30 seconds they recommend.<br /><br />Because it was lunch hour, other people were waiting while the soup heated.  We were all startled when there was a loud bang from the microwave and the plastic cover blew off the top and the container jumped, splattering soup all over the inside of the oven.  It took about five minutes and a lot of paper towels and water to clean up the mess.<br /><br />The soup that remained tasted fine and the meat was more tender than normal for soup in microwavable containers.<br /><br />That said, I cannot recommend it nor will I buy it again.

"The PROS of this tea:<br />*ACTUAL RED TEA (and it does taste like the leaves from Thailand)...<br />*NO nasty food coloring<br />*NO gross paint taste/smell<br />*has anise (see cons) like Thai tea is supposed to<br />*adding whole spices to the water before steeping, boiling those a bit, then steeping them with the tea can be a decent alternative to handling messy loose leaves<br />*holds up to longer steep times--ie it's not the super cheap stem-filled tea most brands market as ""Thai Tea""<br />*convenient<br /><br />The CONS of this tea:<br />*Weak. Very weak. 1 bag per 6oz yields tea half the strength of the very strong stuff in (authentic) restaurants, so instead of being about fifteen cents a bag from my Asian market, it's double that... so that makes it about a dollar JUST in the bags per 18oz serving? Not a great value anymore! There's no way I could justify paying the shipping costs--which are more than 2 boxes typically--on top of higher prices in online retailers (typically--if it was a buck and had free shipping, maybe? probably not, though)<br />*the anise flavor is too subtle--ended up brewing my own spices in<br />*anise isn't the only spice typically in Thai tea, though it is the dominant one<br />*not as red as top quality black/red teas from Thailand and Sri Lanka<br /><br />OVERALL?<br /><br />If I wanted something sweet at work, while there are dozens of tea options out there, this isn't the worst choice by a long shot (but really, so many better, more flavorful teas, authentic or not)--I mean, this is nothing like the gross Pantai stuff that's not only green, not red, tea but is full of chemical yuck... it's not, though, anything like the loose leaves I get that I add spices to and brew in a commercial coffee pot (brew super strong then run the hot water through a second time--it makes the pot in under two mins, so mine turns out like good restaurants but then... most coffee makers can't handle it--the drip drip things ruin it)...<br /><br />In other words, it's okay. It's nothing spectacular but nothing like the awful mess with food dyes and chemical byproducts, either. Wouldn't waste sweetened condensed milk on it--too expensive and this isn't strong enough to handle it--but a little sugar and (real, no thickener junk) cream and it's a basic, decent cup of tea. 3*s because it's quite literally alright, not bad, not great. Just use pure, not tap, water, whatever you drink--tap ruins tea regardless.",Neutral

"I brewed the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee both in a Cuisinart automatic brew coffee maker and a french press. I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.<br /><br />As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.<br /><br />There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.<br /><br />The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.<br /><br />On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.",Neutral

I can't say that I was overly impressed with the flavor of this brand, though. It had somewhat of a medicinal taste. While licorice was originally intended as a medicine, I don't think it should taste like it. I had a few pieces, then shared it with my family. Out of 6 other opinions, three said they did not like it, two really loved it, and one is just a candy addict so pretty much likes anything.

I tried several other extracts, and this is by far the best, with excellent aromatics and the ""heat"" of the cinnamon coming across well.  The only downside is that it does not bring the more savory taste of ground cinnamon with it.  I do not think that this is a shortcoming of the product; rather the savory compounds simply are not alcohol soluble, this would probably require some sort of oil base instead.<br /><br />The mouth of the bottle does not pour particularly well, and tends to dribble.

"As an insomniac of many years, I picked up a Dream Water at my local pharmacy, where they're sold in individual 2.5-oz bottles in two flavors, Snoozeberry and Lullaby Lemon.  I've tried every over-the-counter sleep aid there is, and some help, some don't -- this stuff really works.  It makes me very drowsy, and far as I can tell, there are no adverse side effects.  Both flavors are subtle and pleasant, and contain no calories.  The active ingredient is sodium 80 mg, which might be of concern to those on a low-sodium diet, although 80 mg only represents 3% of the average adult's recommended intake.  The rest is their ""secret blend"" of what I presume is the usual herbals that are reputed to relax you.

Even if you buy it by the 12-pk, it's about $2 a pop! I guess it deepends, then, on how bad you want to sleep.

The cans arrived boxed tightly within a much larger box...packing care was evident and not a single can was dented. Have used this pumpkin to make the most awesome pumpkin pancakes. Just stir it into pancake mix and add a little water/milk and microwave for a vitamin-packed indulgent treat.

I had been using empty bottles from bottled water for him, but they begin to splinter and break up after a couple of days and I worried about him swallowing broken bits of plastic (NOT good for the tummy!).

I do like the occasional hazelnut or vanilla flavors.  I was hoping to have a hint of the flavor, not an overwhelming one.  I was not disappointed.  The smell of vanilla was a lot stronger than the actual taste.<br /><br />The coffee was good, not great or otherwise outstanding, but good.  I'd call this an easy drinking coffee and I feel I could serve it without mentioning that it was vanilla flavored.  All in all, it's a good coffee with a *hint* of vanilla.",Neutral
This coffee contains too much flavor for my taste when used as the sole ingredient brewed.

Cooking Pork Chops couldn't be easier with Shake 'n' Bake Original for Pork. Just coat Pork Chops with coating mix and bake for about 10 minutes.

Otherwise this is great.,Positive

Everything is natural in this beverage, and yet it somehow didn't taste natural to me. I think this is due to its sweetness. If you like a sweeter beverage, you might like this product much more than I did. I was thinking the flavor would have been more subtle, but this was pretty assertive for my tastes.",Negative
"The new canister idea went a little too far, as there is also some thing different with the taste. They dont even taste like onion any more, very bland.

"Remember when Coke came out with their new formula. It was a disaster for them. The company finally relented and brought back the original formula after losing significant market share. This is the same situation. I have been using this drink for years (Cool Citrus and Tropical Fruit) and I have been very happy with it. I am even subscribed to these mixes through Amazon's subscription program. I am ending those subscriptions and I'm not getting this stuff anymore. I recently received 4.5 pounds of Cool Citrus through the subscription program and didn't know that they changed the formula until I went on my ride and took my first few sips -- YUK!!! An excellent description another reviewer used to describe this stuff. The graphics on the packaging has changed with a small caption ""Now with Stevia"". I mixed 2 scoops with 24 ounces of water just like I used to except now this stuff with Stevia tastes like a rotten grapefruit. Maybe I'm mixing it too strong, but this is the amount stated on the label. I don't know the reason the old formula was abandoned. Did it contain potentially banned substances or dangerous ingredients? I hope not, but I know I can't stand the new formula. I would give the old formula 5 stars, but this stuff isn't worthy.",Negative
"I have done my share of reading on this topic and like to think that I provide my pets with not only somewhat healthy, but also palatable food. There are pros and cons to be said about all the brands. With this in mind I feed my dog and cat the Wellness Core brand dry food, but tend to switch between the ""better"" quality canned ones (depending whats on sale). For the most part I've been happy with with the brands I've tried, i.e. Natural Balance,Solid Gold,  Wellness, Merrick, Innova, etc.<br /><br />Open a can of any of the afore mentioned brands, and they won't have that generic pet food smell, i.e. nonspecific and overprocessed. The food made by these companies actually looks like food, not processed mush.Hence the prices they charge.<br /><br />I thought that Science Diet fell into this same category...WRONG!!<br />Opened the first can and immediately got hit with the smell of ....goodness knows what. The food itself was a solid gelatinous mass that I had difficulty mixing..since i add only a small amount of wet food each night, one can lasts a few days. After a day or 2 in the refrigerator, the gelatin type substance only congealed more. This food very obviously contains a great deal of fillers, and yes my pets ate it..but this could be applied to anything not nailed down, so this was no shock.<br /><br />These reviews are highly subjective, and i hesitate to bad mouth something this strongly, but first and foremost I want others to know what theyre getting.

I have it for breakfast with my coffee with some natural peanut butter on top and I don't get hungry and feel energized all morning. I can taste chocolate and coffee flavors and it is quite gritty (which I like) because of all of the fiber--it has all different kinds of fiber in it, so it is a very different coarse texture that I find appealing. It also is not too sweet, but I like that too. I don't put sweetener in my beverages and in general like things barely sweet, so this bar is absolutely perfect. If you're looking for a candy-bar-tasting food bar, this bar tastes nothing like that--more like a healthy, delicious, wonderfully flavored pick-me-up. It also has no coating, and I like that and don't think it needs it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****",Positive

"The cost of Taibi oil is extremely expensive for olive oil, even buying from a small orchard in Sicily. In Sicily, a one litre can of top quality organic oil costs about $12.  This Taibi oil is a bottle half that size so worth about $6.  Can the cost of shipping really be over $40? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another firstclass oil from Sicily available on Amazon for only $20.79 is Mandranova Biancolilla Extra Virgin Olive Oil 17 oz.<br /><br />Olive oil is bottled and released for sale two to five months after pressing. For example, oil that was pressed in the fall of 2010 - as this oil is dated - came to market from February to May of 2011.<br /><br />The shelf life of most extra-virgin olive oils is anywhere from 1 year to 18 months from the bottling date, but it is always a good idea to do as the locals do and buy fresh oil when the new release comes to market.<br /><br />Unlike wine, olive oil does not improve with age, so you can assume a 4-6 month shelf life for opened bottles, and a full year in a sealed bottle from one release date to the next.<br /><br />If you purchase an olive oil that is stronger than you like, just set it aside for a few months and then taste it again. Olive oils gradually mellow over the course of the year.<br /><br />Because olive oil is susceptible to deterioration from air, you may be better off purchasing olive oil frequently, in smaller quantities, rather than purchasing one large container. Most top producers put their oil into dark glass bottles or clear bottles that are covered in a foil wrap. Clear glass bottles allow damaging light to affect the oil, bleaching the color and souring the flavor. Keep your oils away from heat sources, such as a radiator, the backsplash of your stove, or the sun.<br /><br />It is best to keep your olive oil at a slightly cool temperature that does not fluctuate ...but do not refrigerate it.<br /><br />See also the new book:  Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil by Tom Mueller.",Neutral

"I have been purchasing these dog chews for almost a year using subscribe and save. I have a 30 lb beagle and 75 lb Pyrenees-Brittany mix, and they both LOVE these chews. My big dog asks for one every morning. Sometimes the chews will not be cut in half (imagine a full foot long rawhide chew, instead of being cut in half down to a 6inch long chew), but that just means it keeps my dogs occupied for twice as long. I haven't seen any diarrhea or stomach issues as a result of these chews.<br /><br />You get what you see - a GIANT 5 lb bag of rawhide dog chews. I've shopped around at Petsmart, Petco, Pet Supplies Plus, and my local grocery stores, and if you have a dog that likes to chew, this is going to be the most cost-effective, get-your-money's-worth option. $22 gets me rawhide chews for TWO dogs for a MONTH.

"I have been drinking Keemun Congou tea for more than 20 years. My first taste of Keemun was from Harrod's and the bright red color and the fabulous bouquet of Keemun made me a fan for life. In my opinion, the taste should be slightly astringent but sweet on your tongue. I love to open my jar of tea in the morning and inhale the slightly smoky, winey aroma of my tea much like coffee drinkers enjoy the smell of a newly opened can of coffee. Keemun really is the Bordeaux of tea.<br />Then the inevitable finally occurred the company I normally buy my Keemun tea from (Special Teas) went out of business, selling out to Teavana and Teavana has chosen not to carry the Keemun I prefer. Alas I found myself looking for a tea to replace the now unavailable Special Tea's Keemun, so I bought two pounds of the Davidson's Keemun because the price was right. Unfortunately this tea is nothing like the Keemun I love and look forward to every morning. The Davidson Keemun smells green and unfermented, almost like a green tea or perhaps slightly fermented like an oolong. The brew does not have that slight smokiness to it and is not sweet on my tongue.<br />I tried brewing it with more tea but that tasted like I had just used more green straw (someone equated it to being barny) and was not at all pleasing even to my husband who is less particular. In the end I am wondering what to do with the enormous amount of tea I have left and have to give this product a thumbs down.",Negative

So now that I know that, I take them off of her when I start to hear it and throw them out.  I probably shouldn't give it to her at all but Im hoping that eventually she will just chew them completely.  I don't want to waste the whole bag, which is pretty expensive.

"Pros:<br />No added sugar (1 g per 2 Tbsp serving)<br />No added salt (30 mg per serving)<br />Great taste<br />Organic<br />No stirring needed<br /><br />Cons:<br />Expensive, even for sunflower butter (we paid $6.20 per jar here at amazon, with free shipping)<br />Thin consistency (closer to a pourable topping than a 'butter')<br />A bit higher in calories than many nut/seed butters (220 cal per serving)<br /><br />This makes a nice optional butter for anyone with allergies (facility is peanut and tree nut free) or someone just looking for variety.  It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is.  On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower.  It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness.<br /><br />We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either.  It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter.  Since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries, we didn't mind the missing sweetness, but someone used to a more traditional butter product may.<br /><br />Amazon shipping on this product was fast and without any problems (USPS).",Positive

"I got this because everyone says it's great for your dog to play with when he's alone. My dog has several treat dispensing toys to keep him busy: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B11L46"">Atomic Treat Ball Interactive Dog Toy, 3-Inch</a> , <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG"">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball , 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>, and Kong Puppy Kong Toy Medium. He does really well with all of them, the atomic being his favorite and the Kong coming in a close second because he really has to work to get stuff out of there. The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him, though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky, the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way, but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work, you have to tip the jug to get anything out and, well, my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs. I'm glad I got this on clearance at CVS otherwise I'd be a little peeved at paying so much for a toy that doesn't work.",Negative

"Two of my middle-aged cats have shown signs of stiffness in one of their hind legs. I decided to give them Cosequin, a highly recommended supplement for joint health in cats and dogs.<br /><br />One of my cats is a pig and will eat anything that's not nailed down, so I knew giving him the supplement would be a fairly easy process; however, the other cat is very picky and will only eat dry food (he's not even interested in cat treats), so I was concerned that giving him the Cosequin would be an impossible task.<br /><br />Enter Greenies Pill Pockets (chicken flavored). Skittles (the finicky cat) went nuts the second I introduced them. I stuck a capsule inside a Pill Pocket and he snarfed it down at top speed, then started looking for more. And it's been that way ever since. For the first time ever, my cats actually look forward to getting their medication every day! (In fact, the other two cats who aren't receiving medication try to sneak a Pill Pocket every now and then.)<br /><br />The only thing I would caution is that the pockets are fairly small. Cosequin capsules, for example, can be opened and sprinkled on food or into a pocket -- but it took about three pockets to hold one capsule's worth of powder. Thus, I've had to keep the capsule intact, pushing it through the pocket so that it sticks out on both ends. That said, my cats still inhale it like it's the best thing they've ever tasted.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all cat families. This product works miracles.",Positive

Would give this a zero if I could.  I spent a lot of money for crackers and I believe some production error happened.  Every single bag was sealed incorrectly.

I was shipped 4 boxes of expensive stale crap.,Negative
"Well following in the footsteps of the successful MiO comes Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. From a practical standpoint Vitamin Squeeze has a lot going for it. All you need is some water, squirt in some Vitamin Squeeze and bada bing, you now have an energy drink. The drink additive boasts zero calories, zero carbs, and zero sugar. That alone is pretty impressive coming from something labeled as an energy drink. Then of course Vitamin Squeeze is loaded with a fair share of vitamins and I suppose that could be a big benefit for the right consumer.<br /><br />On the other hand I doubt very many people who are concerned with vitamins and healthy beverages will be attracted to the Fruit Punch flavor. I can still occasionally stomach ultra-sugary Kool-Aid or Hi-C and I think that the MiO Fruit Punch is actually on of the better flavors the brand offers. Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch, however, has all the overly sweet taste of these other products with the addition of a nasty tang, probably due to the Vitamin C. At least that is what I'm guessing the bad after taste comes from because I've had the same experience with other Vitamin C beverage enhancers. Either way, the flavor is pretty gross.<br /><br />The other thing about Vitamin Squeeze you need to take into account is the fact that it is far less versatile than MiO or even just bottled drinks. You have to carry around the large, 12-ounce container PLUS whatever you are flavoring with it. It's just not mobile really.<br /><br />***EDIT***<br />I added a third star because I my little brother drinks this stuff all the time and he actually enjoys it.",Neutral

"I tried the Eat, Think, Smile crispy thins, and it was an interesting journey for my taste buds. I was expecting a primarily cocoa/chocolate taste from these thins, but the cocoa flavor was subtle and mixed with rice and sunflower seeds (cocoa is only the fifth ingredient behind brown rice flour, sunflower seed butter, cane syrup and rice flour).  I even tasted sesame seeds and yellow corn in these chips, and that is alot of different flavors for one snack crisp.  The product is all natural and relatively low in sugar (only 6 grams per serving).  I don't mind some combination of tastes (chocolate and peanut butter are great combinations) but cocoa, sesame, sunflower seeds, yellow corn and brown rice?  This product uses quality ingredients, but the wide variety of tastes mixed into one crispy thin was too odd for me. Then again, taste is subjective, so someone else may appreciate the wide variety of flavors in one crispy thin. Just know what you are getting yourself into before you buy.",Neutral
"An Amazon Vines review of the Newman's New Zealand Lamb and Barley Organic dog treats. The product arrived timely and well packaged. I received one 10oz. re-sealable pouch.  Newman's states that the product is organic, which Newman's say means the production systems seek to provide food and fiber products of the highest quality. The treats are rectangular dog biscuits, that are about 1 inch by 2 inches.  Each biscuit is scored in the middle so it is easy to break the biscuit into two pieces.<br /><br />The package listed the ingredients as: Organic barley, Organic lamb, Organic carrots, Organic apples, Organic palm oil, and Organic molasses.<br /><br />Newman's claims that the dog biscuits do not contain poultry by-products, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics, chemical additives or artificial preservatives, no wheat or corn, and no artificial flavors. The biscuits had a pleasant smell and looked like quality dog biscuits.  But of course, the real test was, would the dogs like them. Well, the dogs devoured each biscuit I gave them and I think they would have easily eaten the entire bag at one time if I let them!<br /><br />This seems like a good quality product, which my dogs greatly enjoyed so I give Newman's New Zealand Lamb and Barley organic dog treats a 5 star rating.",Positive

"This stuff is great. I use it in my whirley pop and it makes perfect popcorn. Flavor is pretty darn close to movie theater. Everyone in my family loves this stuff. I do like a bit more salt on my popcorn but this can be a bit too salty even for me. I cut the salt pack open before the rest and take out the salt. I would say I use about half to 3/4 what comes in the pack. Then I cut the rest of the pack open and dump it all in. This is about the right amount of salt for me. The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix. I save the salt and then I use it for future popcorn making without the kit.<br /><br />If I can find some smaller sample packs to try of other brands, I may look into that in the future when it's time to order more. But if I don't ever find anything else, this stuff is pretty good.",Positive

"This product is advertised as a  ""Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy"" and it is. I have a dry scalp and this has been helping. This product seems to not be advertised correctly though it does what it advertises.  Be aware that there are no instructions on its proper use. The oils needed to aid your skin is contained within a petroleum jelly base and this is what you apply. I apply a small dab directly too the scalp after you have dried your hair and I actually avoid getting on my hair as much as possible. If this was the 1950's the 'Greasers' would be using this too slick back their hair. I look at this as a treatment and not a product used all the time. If you get this in your hair it will be like you put petroleum jelly in it and you will have a hard time washing this out.

"***<br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot""; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""citrus, lavender, light smoke"". You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />Instead of Tazo's Earl Grey, I would highly recommend Numi Earl Grey, which does not disappoint in any way and is comparable in cost. It too can be bought in bulk at the time of this review on Amazon.<br />***",Neutral

Ive ordered them before from amazon and had no problem, though this time they came in an opened box and with the expiration code on the bottom of the tin rubbed/blotted out. On some of the packages I could still faintly make out a date from early 2010 though. By no means did I want to give as gifts expired candy, let alone boxes that had been tampered with. I called amazon and they promptly replaced the case, though unfortunately the new case was expired as well(despite me asking for them to check), though the dates had not been rubbed out. At this point, I knew that the entire batch was just probably old and took my chances and asked them to replace with a different flavor(as I knew they would not check), hoping the new flavor was from a different shipment. Luckily, the mango ones I ordered were fine and did not expire until 2012. It was just terribly unfortunate that such a great item had no checks or balances before they left the amazon warehouse- ultimately amazon replaced both boxes, but it was a hassle and disappointment to keep getting old merchandise.",Negative

"I'm a Type 2 diabetic and wanted to try the tablet form of Equal since it doesn't have the ""fillers"" as the packets, thus raising blood sugar levels. I did notice a few points difference in my readings before and after my first cup of coffee. Also, the sweetness level is not as advertised (1 tablet = 1 teaspoon sugar). I have to use 3 tablets and 1 packet of Equal to get the right sweetness that 2 packets give me. The ""fillers"" in the packets include a form of sugar and therefore make the packets' sweetness more intense. So, I can solve the whole problem by not using sweetener in my coffee, but I swear, I've tried that and just can't do it. My solution is: since I drink only 2 cups of coffee per day, I'll continue to use 2 packets of Equal per cup and get the taste I want, while searching for other alternatives. Note: some of the alternatives are expensive and, to me, have an unacceptable after-taste.<br /><br />That said, I will agree with some of the other folks who complained about the ejection mechanism grinding up the tablets into a powder form.

Most disastrously, they brag about using sea salt but they use too darned much of it.  The salty taste lingered throughout dinner.

"I did not purchase product from vendor listed I went to soupsonline website and ordered individual one.

You can also use plain ham bits.<br />I think it takes about 8 hrs or so to cook ie beans are nice and soft and so are the other veggies.<br />This tastes good on the first day but makes even better leftovers as beans breakdown thicken even more and flavors meld<br /><br />The very best thing about this recipe is that if you want your soup thinner add more water or ham base broth if you like your soup thicker start with amount I suggested.<br />I make this soup often in the winter because it has stick to your bone goodness.<br /><br />This can also be used to help flavor green beans...",Positive

I loaded the treat compartments with their favorite chicken stick treats and then rotated the base and put the plastic puzzle pieces in.

"I remember loving these cookies so I was super excited to get a box through Vine. I'm not sure how much the shipping packing from Amazon played into account in my disappointment or if it was all due to Nabisco. The box was pretty damaged when it got to me, dented in several places. When I opened the package, almost all of the cookies were in some state of falling apart- more so than you would expect from the damage the box showed, which is why I'm wondering if some of it came from the factory that way. May of the cookies were coming apart, the top half separated from the cookie bottom. Those that weren't in 2 pieces had the the cookie part crumbling.<br /><br />Despite their sad state, we managed to eat several cookies, holding them together when necessary. And I am sad to say that they were just ""OK"", not at all like the Mallomars I remembered from 10 or so years ago, which is probably the last time I had them. My husband agreed that they weren't quite the same. I thought the texture of the cookie was not good, it was very crumbly. The marshmallow was OK but the chocolate didn't taste all that good. Overall, they were just eh, not at all worth the calories, in my opinion. My kids will probably finish them off, though, as they seemed to enjoy them well enough.",Neutral

"I am not sure how to rate this food. It is definitely better than any of the cheap foods I was feeding my cats before the great pet food recall scare. My cats seem healthy enough (though one of my three cats is trying very hard to be obese... just bought the Aikiou Stimulo cat feeding station to help her loose weight). I have been feeding them Solid Gold for three years now and would have gone on feeding them this forever had I not switched my cat litter from Fresh Step clumping to a non-clumping natural variety and realized my cats have very smelly runny poo. Obviously something in this food is not being digested by my cats. So I took a closer look at the ingredients and began to wonder if the ""grain-free"" idea Solid Gold employs is a great hoax. I mean, how much more nutritious is the potato in Solid Gold as a source of carbs than corn or rice? Also, though the analysis lists this food at 45% protein, the third ingredient that goes into it is potato protein. How much of the 45% protein is from chicken and how much from potato?<br /><br />I have decided I am going to switch my cats to Blue Bufflao when my current bag of Solid Gold is over. Because, though I have taken only one nutrition course, I instinctively know that a bowl of rice is indeed more nutritious than a bowl of potato. Hopefully Blue Buffalo will be easier on their digestive systems too. Apparently Wysong has a ""starch free"" formula but it is way more expensive.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list. The second and third ingredients are potato.<br /><br />Solid Gold Indigo Moon ingredients: Chicken Meal, potatoes, potato protein, Canola Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols) , Chicken, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ocean Fish Meal, Salmon Oil (source of DHA), Dried Chicory Root, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Parsley Flakes, Pumpkin Meal, Almond Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), Sesame Oil (preserved by mixed tocopherols), Yucca Schidigera Extract, Thyme, Blueberries, Cranberries, Carrots, Broccoli, Zinc Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Manganese Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Potassium Iodide, Calcium Panthothenate, Riboflavin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (vitamin B6), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Manganous Oxide, Sodium Selenite, Vitamin D Supplement, Folic Acid<br /><br />Update 10/29/2011: Just wanted to let everyone know that the Aikiou Stimulo cat feeding station is the best thing ever invented for chubby cats. My three cats are eating half what they used to! Which means they are pooping less too, which is kinda awesome. Still trying to finish my bag of Solid Gold though. I keep dry food in a big airtight pail and it stays fresh forever.<br /><br />Update 11/19/2011: Managed to find Wysong Epigen at pretty much the same price as Soild Gold and with free shipping on orders over 50 dollars. Search wag.com<br /><br />Update 12/20/2011: Wysong Epigen is amazing! My cats are shedding their excess weight and running around like little energetic crazies. They don't seem to be eating as much of it as they used to Solid Gold. To touch it doesn't seem greasy like Solid Gold did. PLUS their poo has solidified! Yay!

First, it takes longer than 90 seconds to microwave it.  I usually nuke it for 30 seconds, stir it, then nuke it for another 90 seconds.  It's the same with other Campbell's microwavable products like the Firehouse Chili.  I agree with the other reviewer that it's gritty.  Maybe some sand got in the shell of the clams or it has some small shell fragments?  It also has a funny smell after microwaving it.  I think the funny smell comes from the outer plastic packaging and not the soup.  The soup tastes just fine, but needs some Tabasco or a little spicing up.",Neutral
"I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you!

"If it was my first matcha i would had given it 5 starts but I feel i have to disagree with the majority of reviewers.<br />Its certainly a good quality matcha but i found it lacks aroma and taste compared to other matchas i tried(yuuki-cha, o-cha and ippodo). The taste is very light, almost flat and you have to watch the water temperature as when going over 190 it gets very bitter(never had this problem before). By the way I always preheat my chawan, dry it, sift the matcha, check the water temperature and then whisk it.<br />As for packaging thats the first matcha i tried that comes in a inner bag. Personally i find it annoying and messy not to mention that you will have to expose the whole amount of matcha to oxygen in order to make it easier to scoop. i prefer the cans i got before that comes with sealed top and a oxygen absorber inside. I noticed the loss of flavor from Domatcha much faster than usual.<br />Would i buy it again? maybe. Cant beat the amazon fast ordering convenience. sometimes my japanese orders take too long to arrive and i found myself out of my daily green nectar. otherwise i think the extra money im paying for a higher quality is more than worth since my primary reason to drink matcha is flavor.<br />One more thing: dont bother trying to make koicha(thick ceremony style tea) with domatcha. its not the proper grade for it and you will get a very grainy/powdery/bitter drink. Otherwise it makes a good usucha and its certainly a great value for the price.",Neutral
"These add a creamy, thick chocolately flavor to almost anything but once in a while I experience a very strange aftertaste with the chocolate flavor,usually when I use 2 vs just one in my beverage.<br /><br />The packaging, however, leaves a lot to be desired and unless you want a lot of work when this arrives, you might want to rethink this purchase. In recent weeks, I've purchased 3 cases of this product (that is 12 boxes of 50 single serve cups) in 3 flavors for the local emergency shelter here in Western, MA due to the tornadoes that ripped through my community and those of my family and friends. I am so thankful I looked at this product before just bringing it to the make-shift kitchens and coffee setups on the back of pickup trucks.  This is what I experienced. What follows is actually my 'cut and paste' comments from one of my 'leave packaging comments' for Amazon, so it lists 2 cases vs 3. I purchased 1 first, then had second thoughts and went back and bought the additional 2 flavors (creamy chocolate, cinnamon vanilla (excellent flavor, by the way) and Irish Cream (a bit too subtle in flavor for me-could have a bit more oomph). As such, you'll see me refer to just 2 below.<br /><br />Exterior shipping box was fine and interior 'case' holding product perfectly intact. However, contents (50 in each)are a sticky, gooey, unusable mess. I purchased 2 flavors/2 cases = 8 cartons = 400 of this product and all 8 cartons are a disgusting disappointment. While the majority of the single serve cups are fine, a large handful in every one of the 50-pack boxes are squished, cracked or just ripped open. Contents spilled over the rest of the single serve cups throughout the boxes that are now slimy, sticky and tacky, with what looks like dried and/or tacky curdled milk all over them. I had to throw away 46 cups total and wash every other single serve cup by hand and then find another container to hold them all. I sure won't be buying these again.",Neutral

"I love Great River Orangic Milling products. So I was very excited to add this to my repertoire. I guess I didn't read quite as carefully as I should have. I expected this to be a blend that contained oat flour as well. It's basically just their whole wheat bread flour (an excellent product) mixed with oats. It's a very nice blend. But I buy the whole wheat bread flour in the large bags, and I can easily add my own oats (in fact, this seller sells big bags of those too). So it's not exactly what I was expecting.<br /><br />I'm still giving it 5 stars because it's a good product. I've used it by itself and blending with white bread flour and had excellent results both times. But I just wanted to make clear that it's not a blend with oat flour if that's what you're looking for.",Positive

This makes it very difficult to put your hand in without having it come out coated with sugar granules.  Very very messy and sticky.  The sugar is very over-powering and cinnamon is subtle.  Overall, it's good, but I was disappointed after tasting the original apple chips.  It's for someone who has a very sweet tooth.  Also, if you are familiar with these apple-chips, there are a lot of crumbs--about 1/3 crumbs.  If you are down to the last third of the bag, expect half of what you pop into your mouth to be sugar.",Neutral

As I drank it, it didn't 'feel' fizzy either.<br /><br />That said, the drink isn't completely bad.  If you're in the mood for sweet cherry juice it's probably okay.

"This slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it. Our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet!<br /><br />She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop.

Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.<br /><br />In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products.

"I wanted something like Reese's peanut butter cups, but this has neither enough chocolatey flavor nor peanut buttery.  It needs to be both saltier and sweeter.  It's just like a sort of bland peanut butter w/some unsugared cocoa powder thrown in.  The cocoa powder makes it drier and less oiler, which definite decreases the mouth-feel pleasure for me.  Seems like diet peanut butter w/choco added to make people feel less deprived.  I won't throw it out, but I went back and got Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter instead. I know it's like oranges and tangerines - not exactly the same, but I still think Justin's has a better concept for the heft and creaminess needed as well as a better level of salt.

"I'm a noodle lover. Can't live without noodles at least once a day. I have more than a dozen different types of noodles stocked in my pantry & I love trying new ones too. I've a subscription to 30 packets of Nong Shim's Gourmet Spicy noodles & was expecting this to be much better. Really, the taste is great. Same type of noodles, texture, etc..same spicy flavor packet but there is another packet of soup seasoning included. There's no dried vegetables packet like the Gourmet Spicy flavor has. No dried vegetables flakes & no beef chunks like the description stated, thus false marketing. The price is too much for this. If this is the new & improved Gourmet Spicy noodles, I'd give it 4 stars. I took off 2 stars because of the unworthy price tag & another star because of the false marketing. I read a comment reply in another review here - A Korean reviewer... I agree entirely. Big hype & price tag but disappoints. I'll stick to the Gourmet Spicy if I were you. Worth the try but not 24 packets!<br /><br />Edit: Not false marketing since it seems like only the very first packet had no dried beef & vegetable so I changed the rating to a 3 star. However, the beef ""chunks"" are just flakes. Not enough flakes to notice. There are also dried mushrooms. Now, the mushroom pieces are bigger than the ones in the Spicy Gourmet vegetable sachet.

Anyway, its really mostly apple and grape. Of course, you probably don't want to drink pure kiwi and berry juice, they are just the ""flavor"".  So, this is a lighter flavored alternative.  I like that the carbonation isn't overdone.  There's just a bit of fizz.  Its sweet, but not horribly.  Its definitely better than soda and I like it better than the other carbonated juice drink that I have tried (other one had too much carbonation).<br /><br />I get irritated that the nutrition facts are so brief.  Surely this stuff provides more vitamins and minerals than vitamin C.  Did they kill the vitamins in the manufacturing process or are they just not telling us what is there.  If its there, you'd think the company would want to advertise it.  If it isn't, where did it go?

"I was shopping for a balsamic vinegar that was ""better"" than the basic types you can find in a typical, non-gourmet supermarket. I found this one in an Italian shop in Little Italy, NYC and was assured that it was one of their better brands - however, for the ""best"" you had to spend a lot more. Not ready to spend bigger bucks, I brought this one home and tried it with fresh mozzarella, Jersey tomatoes, fresh basil and a drizzle of good olive oil. Mmmmm. The difference in flavor, complexity and finish was instantly noticeable. There is an instant hint of sweetness followed by the tang of of acetic acid. If you have only had the $5 / 32 oz bottle of balsamic that's sold in the supermarkets, step up to something significantly better. You will be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />However, to fully appreciate good balsamic vinegar, you need to taste some of the aged (and more expensive) offerings. My local Italian food store gave me a taste of their ""house"" balsamic - a direct import. It was sweeter with a much milder acid finish. Plus the consistency was more like a syrup than a traditional wine vinegar. Sorry, I don't have the name but it costs about fifty percent more than this one and I think, for a treat, it's worth it. For every day use, this one fits the bill. The owner also said that the balsamics costing upwards of several hundreds of dollars are for ""special occasions"".

I read the ingredients on the Evo red meat and was really impressed.  I gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food isn't really a bargain if your dog won't eat it or get any enjoyment out of it.  The first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it- and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough!  I agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up.  He is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him, although I wish the price were a little more reasonable.",Positive
"This soup has a nice zesty flavor, very tasty for a (slightly) lower sodium soup.  It just doesn't have enough of the vegetables pictured on the label.  There might be two or three spoonfuls in the entire package.  This might be a good soup to have with something else (sandwich or salad) or as a snack, but it's not enough food to be a meal on its own.<br /><br />I also have a problem with this being labeled as having two servings.  Really??  Who is going to eat half of this container?  Campbell's: label it as one serving.  The entire package is only 100 calories - why do you need to play labeling games?  I'm guessing it's to try to hide the true sodium number (which is better than some soups, but still high when you consider most people WILL eat the entire package contents)  You're not fooling us.  We *can* multiply by 2.",Neutral

The taste was good, i did add a little tony's seasoning salt (that's just me i add it to almost everything). Overall i was surprised, but in a good way.

I was really hoping it was one of those dinners that everything was included, and it was an easy breezy half hour from the pantry to serving--this isn't that kind of boxed dinner, but more like a ""hamburger helper"" for chicken breast.<br /><br />I might buy it again, but it's not something for my ""emergency pantry"" for when I need a complete meal fast.",Neutral

The flavor was awful, I would venture to say disgusting. So much so that this stayed in my freezer for over four months. Every week or so I'd give it another shot and take a few bites, remember how disgusting it is, and be done.

"If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's RÃªverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",Positive
"The Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix is quite tasty.  Easy, just put the packet of crystals in a cup and add water.  Although the packet did not indicate an precise amount of water, just filled up a 12 oz cup and the tea was still strong. The taste is predominately ginger with a slight hint of lemon.  So, you have the zing with a bit of a kick. Quite tasty, and easy to take on the go and when traveling.",Positive

"I like coffee a lot.  I drink my coffee black, and I love the varieties from Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Gevalia, Arriba!.  So when I had the opportunity to try this new coffee from Melitta, I was eager to see what they had to offer.<br /><br />My setup is a Gevalia 12 cup coffee maker using Melitta No. 4 unbleached cone filters.  For the trial, I brewed 6 cups of the Melitta the same way that I do my Starbucks - two rounded scoops using the Gevalia coffee scoop.  I was a little surprised at how light it came out, and it did not have a lot of flavor.  It definitely came out lighter than the other coffees that I have used - I have been getting satisfying results from my coffee maker and brands listed above using this method for 5 years.  For the next few pots that I made I used ""heaping"" scoops to try to get it stronger.  While it came out darker, I was disappointed in the overall flavor.  Since this is listed as a ""medium"" roast, I was looking for something on par with either either the Starbucks House or Peru Chanchamayo roasts.  This may be unfair since these are both Latin American beans, and I could not find anything about the origins of the Melitta Classique Supreme.  I found the flavor slightly earthy, but there just wasn't a lot that stood out.  I like coffees that are have citrus flavors or rich and nuttier.  Ultimately it is more of a lack of flavor that stuck with me.  It is unoffensive but underwhelming.<br /><br />If you are a current Starbucks or other coffeehouse drinker, you will likely find this somewhat disappointing.  If you are looking for a step up from Folgers you might like what you find.  As I think about a little harder, I would say that this compares favorably with Millstone coffee.  You'll probably like this coffee from Melitta if Millstone is right up your alley.",Neutral

"Kellogg's Crunchy Nut: Roasted Nut & Honey<br /><br />Much better than expected!  I generally don't gravitate towards the 'O' shaped cereals, my favorite cereal is Honey Bunches of Oats.  That being said, when I saw this Nut & Honey cereal, I figured I'd give it a try.  It's tastier than I imagined, it has a stronger honey flavor than most honey-flavored cereals do.  The 'enlarged' picture of the cereal on the box makes it look like there's more nut 'shavings' than there really are, but that being said, there's enough nut there to make a difference and have the cereal taste slightly nutty, which is a good thing in my opinion.  ...I'm not one to eat (or snack on) dry cereal, but this one makes the cut, it's currently sitting next to me on the desk.",Positive

I give my dog 1 piece and it keeps him occupied with chewing for a good 20 minutes.<br /><br />As far as ingredients go, yes, the first ingredient is in fact beef. However, everything that follows is a junky filler - soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat, rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, etc. Hasn't Purina (the maker of this dog food) heard that soy can be terrible for dog's stomachs? I haven't seen any Purina brands that provide good nutrition for dogs, and this one is no exception.",Negative

I have a 10 y/o chihuahua and she really likes this. It is little tiny cubes of dog food mixed with rice. She has lost most of her teeth yet she is able to eat this easily. The cubes are easier to eat then the typical wet dog food that is in a can and then you have to mash up--she can grab onto the cubes easily.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that the pouches are designed in a way that makes some of the dog food stick to the bottom of the pouch. The bottom is concave so it is like a little pocket that traps food.<br /><br />But I would recommend this for anyone with a small dog who is getting up in years. Especially if you have a dog w/ dental problems or who has lost teeth. My dog weighs about 10 lbs and one of these pouches a day along with a dog treat is plenty enough for her.,Positive

Any great medicinal effects of the ginger (for nausea) would be negated with this sugar.<br />I served it hot, and it was relaxing, like tea, but too sweet in my opinion.  I do not drink sodas or put sugar in my coffee, so maybe I'm just not used to it, but I couldn't finish it because as it cooled, the sweetness seemed to get stronger.<br />Served hot, and in small doses, this could be a nice sweet after dinner drink.

"Flour is a Peruvian varietal packaged in Washington State, near Lynwood, near where I lived last year.  It is ""from Lynwood, WA, USA.""  In my suburban Jewish Mother opinion, this product ""should"" not be $30 a small box, but it is properly milled (fine grind) and probably on a small mill by a lot of people devoted to quality, that part shows, *** for quality.  It's not USDA Organic minus *.  Minus another * for price, and if it's kosher/vegan add 1/2 *.  (not kosher certified on box.)<br /><br />I did find medium grind USDA Organic corn meal only in the local organic chain store (New Seasons is the only local grocery-type store that has both 100% organic produce and packaged foods, some ""traditional"" ones and for about 20% more than ""traditional"" groceries, but a consistent stock, responsive management, friendly clerks...and most importantly lots of stores they are all the same inside.) ""Medium"" grind will NOT make a good tortilla, it will crumble, you need fine grind or a grinder.  The product being reviewed IS the fine grind.<br /><br />So why did i buy it? it's the right grind for tortillas with the tortilla maker i bought.<br /><br />The flavor is a bit different too, not corny if you compare with the GMO cheapo tortillas from the usual grocery store, but closer to the taste of a handmade organic tortilla you might find somewhere in a health food store like Eerewon (good luck with that, Erewon's mostly in Los Angeles) or maybe Whole Foods, did not check there.  If you're in Berkeley, CA try Berkeley Bowl.  If you're in Washington or Texas, try Central Market.  Trader Joe does not have organic corn tortillas as far as I know.  I found one shop in my travels, can't remember which shop, so that's why I am doing it myself.  It's more fun this way and they can be frozen.  The idea is to make little dough-balls (great with kids, grandkids, kindergarteners) and smash them.<br /><br />So mix up the and distilled water and let it sit in fridge, then make appropriate dough ball corresponding to whatever size tortilla you want. It has to be cold but not frozen, like playdough for grilled breads. Also you want it about as thick as an old LP vinyl record, not too thin but not too thick, make the thickness of one ceramic bath tile.  You'll know right away if it's too thin.  If it's not done in two minutes, it's too thick.  If you don't have a cast iron press, use a rolling pin or an empty wine bottle.<br /><br />experiment with different flours, but always heat and grease the machine first, otherwise dough will STICK.  Testing with a drop or two of oil or water works.  I use organic flax or olive with a pastry brush, you want a thin coat of oil, then press.  If you're making tortillas, get the pan greased and heated, but also coat the tortilla press so the tortilla will press off, I don't like plastic, a sandwich baggie is another method for those who can't have any oil.  If you're vegan use egg substitute for the pizzelle, post if that works.  If you're kosher, no problem, tortillas are paerve.<br /><br />The griddle or the pan has to be HOT and you have to watch it.  no turning of the back, watch it or you will have a black tortilla or a well done pizzelle.<br /><br />It's not a pancake, it cooks longer and texture is different.<br /><br />Pizzelle should take one minute tops if everything is set up, someday maybe I will make a youtube...don't hold your breath, you tube involves talking sound editing i don't know what else skills I am not great at.<br /><br />In any event, both keep in the freezer and can be thawed when ready to use by leaving on counter for a few hours or even in a pinch in a toaster, and make good, cheap nutritious snacks, as long as healthy fats used and no sugar overload is in the pizzelle or dairy high fat cheesy stuff poured on top of either bread, because they are both specialty breads and best with a bit of something but also good by themselves if fresh.<br /><br />since first posting i notice this http://www.amazon.com/Regular-finely-ground-perfect-recipes/dp/B0006N2PE0/ref=pd_sbs_gro_5 and others with lower prices, i don't know if it is same quality, fresher, etc. but if you want FRESH, buy whole dry corn cut off cob yourself and mill it with a Champion juicer MILL attachment.  If you want purple pastry, you can still find a better price and then compare quality.  Food should be fresh regardless of who sells it to you.  It should not be $30 with s/h.  It should be roughly what you pay at a specialty grocery store, and if your local store has overpriced stock, just print out the amazon ad and take it to the manager, they will usually honor fair market value if they have something overpriced it's often because they did not first check amazon.  Amazon does beat or meet most local grocery stores even on obscure gourmet items! I suppose it's worth it if you want something fast, live in WA, get it without paying shipping and are going to use it for coloring baked goods naturally...beet juice works well for that also.<br /><br />it might be instructive to get someone to photograph small samples of all these flours, so people don't have to buy a box and find out they don't have a recipe for it, or it's stale or not what they expect, and to have little descriptions of each sample, like we do with hops, wine, cheese...because all flours are not created equally!  the organic ones especially can be expensive...but not this expensive.  sometimes the cost of s/h is inflated because of s/h ""policy"" that might be something not just this seller can look at and scrutinize, most of my complaints (very few actually considering how much i buy and how consistently i buy) boil down to some shipping/handling problem, but s/h will only communicate with seller who hired them....it is generally only a problem with foodstuffs, a broken machine can be photographed, repackaged and often repaired locally, food cannot.  there should be separate written policy for pricing packing and shipping foodstuff, some vendors do a great job, others not so much.",Neutral
"I am extremely dissatisfied with the product and customer service from this company (Barry Farm). It says on the page for this product ""Usually ships within 6 to 10 days"". I ordered this product over three and a half weeks ago and just received it. I was still charged over $8.00 for shipping (more than the item was worth). I took precautions for the product not to sit in the sun and melt, ordering it so it would be delivered on a day I was home. This effort failed; the shipping and delivery dates changed...twice. I got an email from Amazon stating that they had not received notification of shipping from the seller (Barry Farm). I emailed the seller, received no response. I then got an email from Amazon a day later with a delivery time frame. The product did not arrive during the stated time frame (late). When it finally arrived, I received a bag of melted goo.

"This is a resubmittal of a previous review.  Originally, when I received my cheesecake I was very disappointed with the careless way it had been packaged and delivered - and I said so in my review.  I NOW say that if anybody ever says that Omaha Steakes doesn't care about their product feedback, do NOT believe it.  After submitting my original review, I was contacted by Mr. Sendgraff of Omaha Steaks who apologized for their poor packaging and inormed me that Omaha Steaks has a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products and, that he was refunding my entire purchase price, including shipping.  Even after I told him we had eaten the cheesecake, and it was really quite good, he insisted that my experience had not met their 100% satisfaction guarantee standards and my refund would stand.

"When I first popped one of these in my mouth, I was really pleased with the light caramel flavor of the hard candy outer shell. The flavor was a little more delicate than a typical <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AXEFY"">Werther's Original Hard Candies, 34-oz.</a>, but it still felt substantial. When the candy shell finally dissolved and broke, it let loose a blast of pure honey, so much so I felt like someone had pounded a beehive into my mouth. Wow! Sweet! I tried another and this time bit through the caramel shell right away. I ended up with a sticky sweet agglomeration of caramel and honey that threatened to glue my mouth shut if it didn't dissolve all my teeth first. Wow! Really sweet! If my dentist doesn't own stock in the maker of this product, he should. Doesn't matter, though, because after eating this candy, I'm probably going to be making his next three BMW payments anyway. So, I'll just say, hey, this candy is fine, but it's nothing but caramel and honey mixed together, and it can be over-powering-ly sweet. As for the pick-me-up, all I can say is, yep, that's what sugar does. And the vitamin boost? Yeah sure, but a piece of fruit or a glass a milk could probably do the same. I have to say, this is not a bad product, but it's nothing more than a semi-natural candy masquerading as something (energy boost with vitamins) that it really is not. If you love visiting your dentist, schedule an appointment before you try this candy. If you'd just as soon stay as far away from your dentist for as long as possible, I think you need to stay away from this cavity catalyst candy.",Neutral

"Ok, I have to admit I was a little intrigued by the concept of this candy.  Well sorta candy, I'm not sure what you would classify this product as.  It claimed to give you energy and it was made of honey, that's actually pretty neat and healthy sounding.  That being said, there were a few things that just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />The drop is basically a hard candy coating wrapped around liquid honey, or what I'm assuming is the honey in the product.  This honey has a very sweet medicinal taste to it and the outside coating is exactly like a hard candy.  Right down to the stick on your teeth and be impossible to get off aspect.  The inside did taste better than the outside coating and had a lot richer flavor to it.  But alas, that sensation didn't last very long as there wasn't very much in there.<br /><br />I didn't experience any uplift in energy at all from this product.  But I did find it good as a sort of cough drop.  It definitely eased my coughing back when I had a cold.  This product also dissolved pretty well into hot tea to help soothe the throat that way too.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with the ingredients lift.  Corn syrup was featured pretty prominently with honey coming in listed after that.  So there wasn't as much honey as there could have been in this product.  But it also had some vitamins thrown in and the ingredient list wasn't that large.  So it came out ok all in all.<br /><br />I don't see myself getting this product too much unless I'm sick.  Its ok but nothing I would go out of my way for.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011",Neutral

"I was excited with the concept of being able to burn calories and boost my metabolism by consuming one can of a flavored drink.  After opening a can and taking one sip, the disappointment was written all over my face.  The taste is horrible.  I can not even force myself to drink one whole can.  I sipped it as long as I could and poured the rest down the drain.  The flavor is strange - I don't how else to put it.  It is bitter and has a bad after taste.  I could smell the Raspberry flavoring but the awful taste was too much for me to handle.  I have tried other energy drinks like Monster, and I did not care for the taste of those either. The taste of the Celsius Raspberry Acai actually reminded me of those drinks, the staleness and bad after taste. On a plus note, one can only has 10 calories compared to other energy drinks that are very high in calories.<br /><br />In regards to boosting your energy level, I could see a difference.  I only drank half of a can, and after a couple hours I felt very fidgety, energetic and wide awake.  However, my mouth keep watering like I was going to ""up-chuck"" and I kept burping up the flavor of the drink.<br /><br />Even if I was guaranteed I would loose one pound a day by consuming one can daily, I would still not be able to force myself to drink it.  Maybe the other flavors might be more appealing to my taste buds, but this flavor was not for me.",Negative

"The appeal of this specific product is suposed to be the packaging. The individual stacks of crackers are smaller than typical.<br /><br />Well, it falls a little short. The packages aren't anywhere near single-serving. There are 8 2-3/8"" squares in each hard to open pouch. That's about twice -- close to three times -- what I would consider a single serving.<br /><br />The pouches are so thick, you either need a sicsors or knife to open them, and there is no way to roll them closed again. You either need to plan on finishing them before they go stale, or find another container to store them in. Hardly what I'd choose to call ""fresh stacks"".<br /><br />The crackers themselves were fine. Nothing spectacular one way or the other about them. But then again, we're talking about a pretty utilitarian cracker here, so one person's spectacularly good would be someone else's spectacularly bad. So not much to say there.<br /><br />All in all, unless the size of the pouches are just the size you usually want, it's not worth paying extra for these. I'm just going to get regularly packaged crackers, and store them in a larger plastic bag to keep them fresh. If I'm going to need a plastic bag anyway, why pay extra for these harder to get open pouches that need to be opened more often, too?",Negative

The packaging indicates it is made with 100% Arabica coffee and only natural ingredients at 45 calories.  I found it very a little creamy, strong, dark, lightly sweet, with a strong kick.  Some may want to add sweetener to it in an effort to balance the flavor. I personally found the coffee tastes much better over ice with added sweetener.

"This is one of the most delicious teas I have ever tasted! It's so smooth, rich and flavorful. A perfect dessert tea. The best way to enjoy it, in my opinion, is plain/black. That way, nothing interferes with the flavors and you can taste each one distinctly - the black tea, caramel and vanilla (despite the name, the caramel is stronger than the vanilla) - as well as experience how they interact and balance each other. It truly is a harmonious blend.<br /><br />For an extra sweet, creamy treat, I sometimes like to add Half & Half and one sugar cube (about 35 calories total). It tastes amazing that way too, though the sweeteners do mute the caramel and vanilla a bit.<br /><br />Whatever you do, please do NOT add honey to this tea. I did that twice and ended up with a bitter cup. (Honey brings out a sharp burnt flavor in the caramel.)",Positive

I have never tried the cheddar as I cannot have dairy, but I'm sure they are good too.<br /><br />The only problems I have with the crackers are the high saturated fat content and the price.  Of course, with any gluten free item, they are a bit pricey, but that's to be expected, unfortunately.  But they really don't give you a lot in the box for the price.<br /><br />I saw the 'saltine' or 'table' cracker version of Glutino's the other day at my health food store and I was going to get them because I've been wanting 'saltine' type crackers for my soup, but the saturated fat content was really high!!!  Three grams of saturated fat for just THREE crackers.  Ridiculous!!!  Of course, some people don't care about the nutritional/health facts pertaining to the food they eat, but I do... and I would NOT get these because of that.  But the other crackers are really GOOD and the saturated fat content isn't too high.  Still not the greatest, but because they are so delicious, I've made an exception for them.",Positive

Breakfast blend is no longer the mild coffee flavor that I have come to enjoy for the past few years. It is now a medium coffee with noticeable burnt flavor along with some bitterness. I don't know why Starbucks messed with a good thing but after reading that their new line of blonde coffees offers no taste at all I will now be forced into looking for a new mild blend of coffee.

Also they are very dry, need to have a drink when you eat them, so that makes a poor choice for a on-the-go snack too.<br /><br />I thought it was OK as pre-workout, perhaps because of the sugar giving me a little energy boost... but still, I'd rather just eat a cookie if I want a sugar spike.<br /><br />Also, the Orange Cranberry flavor has no noticeable cranberries or cranberry taste.

"I have loved Yogi Cocoa Spice for years. I noticed the name on this item was different (it's ""Mayan""!), and we're calling it a ""supplement"". But I took a chance on 6 boxes, to save time tracking down the old Cocoa Spice. I hoped for the best.<br /><br />The flavor is different, and if I still had an old box I would probably find the formulations are different. This is pretty good for a cocoa tea, to drink instead of eating chocolate,  But it isn't as rich as the original tea. The flavors don't blend together as well, or something. Maybe more focus on marketing and less expensive ingredients?<br /><br />It's not bad, and it is in the same ballpark as the original tea. But I won't be drinking it as frequently. I don't want to have to add coconut milk calories to make it taste as good as the original.

"I tried MIO when it first came out and enjoyed the fruit punch flavor. A couple squirts in a bottle of water turned it into a tasty flavored treat. I decided to try this sweet tea variety, and I wasn't too impressed. The flavor just seems off to me, not what I'm accustomed to enjoying from sweet tea. I tried it with just one squirt and with a few, the flavor seems off either way. I'd suggest if you're new to MIO, try one of the other flavors first to see how you enjoy it. If you're a huge sweet tea fan, this may suit you but it didn't sit well with me or my household.<br />Overall, I still prefer Crystal Light packets in my water over MIO, as the flavor is more consistent and they're cheaper where I purchase them in bulk.",Neutral

You can get a gas station cappucino for less or buy a cappucino maker.  A maker would make up for itself cost-wise in a short time if you're not spending tons of money on buying the cappucino.",Neutral

"This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste.  There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.  I will definitely be trying other types of Melitta coffee in the future.",Positive

"I know this dog food is supposedly healthy and packed full of nutrients, but I just can't shake the pet-owner's gut feeling that it's not necessarily the healthiest. It is though, a GREAT little ""appetizer"" that I add to the top of my dogs' regular food that gets them to start eating (they're both a little picky). They love the abundant chunks of meat and I think it adds a little variety to their meals.

"I received the two ""Mission Pack Space Food Sampler with Astronaut Ice Cream and Space Food Sticks"" packs I purchased in the mail today. I initially panicked when I saw them - both were packaged in ""Astronaut Mission Pack"" boxes that said they contained ""3 Assorted Freeze-Dried Space Foods."" This is not the packaging shown in the picture, and there is nothing on the box about Space Food Sticks (I wasn't too concerned about the magnet). The Space Food Sticks were the whole reason I ordered these samplers, as a surprise gift of nostalgia for a friend. When I finally opened the boxes, I saw that 2 Space Food Sticks and a magnet had been added each, so I DID receive the product that was promised. However, I still feel a bit cheated and deceived - I was expecting a fun gift box to present to my friend, as shown in the picture, and the boxes had some tears on them, perhaps from being opened to add the additional Space Food Sticks and magnet.<br /><br />In terms of the food items themselves - pretty much what I expected and I'm happy with them(and definitely what I was prepared for based on what other reviewers said).<br /><br />On a side note - because many of the older reviews for this product refer to additional items that are no longer included, it would be nice if they were updated or removed. I was sort of bummed to learn that this product used to come with freeze-dried food (that many reviewers seemed to love!) that are no longer included.<br /><br />Overall, I'm OK with the product - I got the food items I was expecting and most wanted - but the product picture needs to be updated, and the reviews should match the product currently available.",Neutral

"My 12 year old dog was never touched these treats... that is, until I had to put him on steroids (prednisone) and anti-seizure medications (phenobarbital) that made him ravenously hungry!

Now that he's on his medications, he'll eat them, but with no real zeal. He jumps and begs for other treats, but simply carries these dry, hard treats onto his bed, where he eats them at his leisure.<br /><br />So, if you have a chowhound who will eat anything, go for it.

"Here's the email I sent to the company after I read that it contains soy lecithin: I talked with your representative on the phone who was unable to tell me if the soy lecithin in your hazelnut dark chocolate and almonds is from GMO soy.  Since 93% of all soy is genetically modified, I'm assuming that it is a GMO.  GMOs (genetically modified organisms) have never been tested for safety in humans.  In animal studies, they have been shown to cause organ damage and infertility.  Monsanto, one of the companies that produce GMO seeds, infiltrated the government to get approval for it's products.  GMOs have been banned in many European countries.  Most soy, corn, canola, zucchini, breakneck squash and Hawaiian papaya are GMOs. Organic products cannot be genetically modified.

"I ordered what is pictured, seeing the word ""Sockeye"" written on the can:  ""Red Salmon Traditional Style Sockeye Packed Fresh in Alaska"" but what I actually received were 12 Chicken of the Sea cans that say, ""Red Salmon Traditional Style All Natural Packed Fresh in Alaska."" Inside the can, the meat was definitely more red than canned pink salmon or canned chum salmon (keta salmon) but perhaps slightly less red than genuine sockeye salmon. Since king salmon (chinook salmon) is highest in fat and too valuable to sell as canned salmon, it means that Chicken of the Sea might be selling the less valuable, less tasty, coho salmon (silver salmon) as ""red"" salmon and deliberately trying to deceive as many people as possible that they purchased the more valuable, tastier, sockeye salmon. Coho salmon (silver salmon) is slightly redder, slightly higher in fat, and slightly more valuable than pink salmon or chum salmon (keta salmon) but less red, lower in fat, and less valuable than genuine sockeye salmon.<br />  The encyclopedia says that coho salmon can also be called, ""red salmon"" or ""silver salmon.""  Sockeye salmon can also be called, ""red salmon.""  Chum salmon can also be called, ""silverbrite salmon"" or ""keta salmon.""  The 12 cans that I received say, ""INGREDIENTS: RED SALMON, SALT.""

These cans do say, ""Wild Caught.""<br />  My final conclusion: I believe that I probably did receive genuine, wild-caught, Alaskan sockeye salmon in my 12 cans because the meat is red enough and the taste is good enough.

Watch out with the image your leaving with your customers because first we are Amazon customers.<br /><br />About Proflowers i had to enter to their web page and had to contact them through Skype, they obviously appologized but they were helpful.<br /><br />Would i recomend this seller, flowers etc? Only if you dont need to get the flowers on a ceratin date because the flowers are beatiful but the timing is not so good. You have to be ver patient.",Negative
"This candy is quite good. I know it has to be sent cold but let it get down to room temperature and the taste and texture is quite amazing. The only issue I had with it is that since it's a pound or two in a single bag, the licorice gets wrapped up in itself and it's hard to pull it apart with alot of effort. Great Product overall though!",Positive
Tried to give these treats to two different dogs.  Both did not like it and would not eat it.,Negative
"Did not seem to work for me, but have only used for a month, so will wait and see if with longer use it is helpful.",Neutral
My cat became ill like another poster and was vomiting throughout the day.<br />I am very concerned about this because she also has diarrhea now. This has never happened to me before so I will not be repurchasing.,Negative
This gift basket arrived without the message I wrote and when my friend received it she had no idea who it was from.  She told me in no uncertain terms to never buy again from this seller.  She said when she called to find out who the basket was from she was treated very rudely....and she ended up making five calls just to find out who to thank.  I have never had a recipient be angry about a gift before until now.,Negative
"These are hard cookie like treats. I haven't seen my dog eat more than one of these. She just buries them. I keep finding them when I cut the lawn. Unfortunately, these are just about the only thing my dog or even cat won't eat and I wish they would.",Neutral
This coffee is pretty much nasty. A very light roast that has little taste other than acid. The only way we've been able to drink it is by making a blend with a much darker roast. Definitely one of the worst whole bean coffees I've ever purchased.,Negative
"I must begin by saying I love flavored coffee.  However, in my opinion, many flavored coffees tend to be terribly overpowering to the point where I typically brew my flavored coffee with a 50/50 mix of flavored coffee to regular coffee.  Normally I brew my coffee with 1 tablespoon of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water and use 1 packet of sugar per cup.<br /><br />I must admit that traditionally I am not a huge fan of Starbucks.  While they put out an excellent quality product, I think their beans tend to be over roasted.  However, I am the first to say it is still a decent cup of coffee.  So when I had the opportunity to try the Starbucks Natural Fusions line, I jumped on the chance.  When I received my bag of Starbucks Vanilla flavored coffee, I pulled out the coffee maker and brewed up a cup.<br /><br />The bouquet of the coffee grounds was a bit unusual.  There was a definite aroma of fine coffee beans, but there was an underlying odor that I can not place.  The ground coffee did not have a distinct vanilla aroma that I could detect.  The same was true with a brewed cup.  While there was a distinctive coffee scent, I still could detect the mystery scent which still did not smell like vanilla to me.<br /><br />The first sip resulted in an overpowering bitter flavor.  Having spent significant time in the Caribbean and South America, I am no stranger to the strong brewed coffees that are prevalent in some countries I have been to.  I am unsure of the source of the bitterness in the coffee (maybe the sarsaparilla root listed in the ingredients), but the bitter flavor was very significant.  The bitter flavor did become less noticeable with the more coffee I drank.  While I became accustomed to the bitterness, it never really went completely away.<br /><br />I really did not detect any vanilla flavor in the coffee, even when used at full strength.  In my opinion, the bitterness really detracts from any flavor of the coffee.  I am sure some people might love this aspect of the coffee, but for me it did not work.<br /><br />Overall, this did not seem to be a bad cup of coffee, but I just could not get past the overwhelming bitter flavor.  I would recommend this blend to people who like an intense, bitter flavor to their coffee.  If you prefer a milder cup of joe, then I would pass on this coffee.  I think this will be a wonderful product for the right person; however, that person just is not me.<br /><br />J. E. Nelson",Neutral
"12 out of 24 units is not an assortment.  Decaf is not coffee, and flavored hot drinks are no<br />excuse for not including coffee in the varities dispensed.  I don't care about the<br />packaging, it gets tossed, but to include only 2 or three coffees is ridiculous.<br />I'll not be buying from this seller in the future. Its safer to buy directly from Keurig.",Negative
"These mixes are excellent for people with gluten issues.  The Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix is by far the<br /><br />best of all their products and I have been using it for 3 years.  These are superb,  even though they are<br /><br />gluten free.  Add chopped pecans and they are even better.  Just make sure you follow the directions and<br /><br />freeze before cutting.<br /><br />The price is excellent also, much better than any store I shop in.",Positive
"We are big fans of Olive Oil from Spain, and we like Zoe products so much that we ordered a dozen bottles of Zoe 100% EV Arbequina, but i will change my subscription after this experience.  The twelve plastic liter bottles were shipped loose in one of Amazon's light-duty boxes with two of those small plastic air-bags.  The box was not meant to have so much weight rattling around loose and the UPS guy asked me to open it to make sure that there was no problem with the merchandise.  the bottles were beat up and squashed, but thankfully none had been crushed open.  I know that the manufacturer does not send them to Amazon warehouse like that.  Don't the warehouse packers go to handling class ? ? ? ?  :-(",Neutral
"If you are a cashew fan, you wil love this. The cans I purchased were mainly cashews - of which I am not a big fan. However, while I do not care for cashews, I do have friends who would find that a plus rather than a minus regarding this product! Bottom line, if you like cashews, it's five stars. If not, don't purchase this item.",Neutral
I am very fond of Yogi Egyptian Licorice tea and when visiting my sister couldn't find it at the grocery store so I picked up the Lemon Ginger which has some of the same ingredients including black pepper. I tried it 3 times but just can't drink it. It tastes like someone ground pepper in my tea.,Negative
"I am very disappointed with this tea.  It says green tea, but doesn't taste like green tea.  I think the white tea overwhelmed the green tea.  Tastes like sweetened water with some lemon flavor.  Also says it contains caffeine, doesn't say how much, can't feel any of the caffeine.",Negative
"Beautiful popcorn when popped and when sitting on the shelf waiting. It popped both white and yellow making the bowl just look more appealing. The hulls did just explode! It was amazing, I've never had popcorn do that before. Great deal, I'm glad we bought the 6 pack. Worked out to about $2/lb. I think some people who gave a bad review must have gotten a bad batch because ours is awesome!",Positive
"Our two kids tried various formula brands (at different times): Enfamil, Similac, Up & Up (Target), Parent's Choice (Wal-Mart), Kirkland (Costco). With exception of Similac, which one of the kids did not seem to like, they can take any brand, so we mostly use Kirkland. I buy Bright Beginnings when it's available, and on sale (I bought it for $7, $5, but current $10 seems to be a decent price, too). The kids don't have a problem with it. I'm not sure if it's any better or worse than other brands, but since all manufacturers are supposed to follow the same FDA standards, I see no reason to overpay for a more recognized and overpriced brand.",Positive
